# Report disagreements between the item payload tables and the ownership ledger.
#
# Both directions matter, and neither is fatal to a character load any more - the
# load path skips what it cannot reconcile and counts it. That is exactly why this
# exists: what used to announce itself as a lockout is now silent, and the only way
# to see it is to look.
#
#   orphan payload rows   player_items / player_pet_items with no item_current_owner
#                         row. The load takes the item as the player's, and the next
#                         save inserts its row (the claim model, ADR 0002). Nothing is
#                         lost; the count says how many items have been picked up and
#                         saved on a server that has not saved them again since.
#
#   missing payload rows  item_current_owner rows for a player whose payload row is
#                         gone: an item the player dropped, used up or lost, which was
#                         then extracted. The row is inert and the next boot deletes
#                         it (reap_unheld_player_items() in item_claim_repository.c),
#                         except one an auction's custody row, an artifact_domain_state
#                         row or a child row still references, and one whose item an
#                         older copy in another payload still carries.
#
#   ./scripts/item_ownership_audit.sh            # summary counts

#
# Read-only: this script issues SELECTs and nothing else. Repair is a separate,
# deliberate act - see the deletion guidance in docs/guides/ if you need it, and
# dump any row before removing it, because that copy is the only record of the item.
