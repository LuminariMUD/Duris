![DurisMUD - a dragon circles a citadel between moonlit ruins and a volcanic fortress](docs/assets/durismud-readme-header.webp)

DurisMUD is a long-running dark-fantasy MUD built around a global race war
between good and evil. Its text world combines full player-versus-player
conflict with exploration, quests, ships, crafting, guilds, and powerful
artifacts.

This repository contains the game server, world data, area-building toolchain,
database schema, regression tests, and operational scripts.

The C-style sources under `src/` are compiled as C++20. Network I/O and mutable game
state remain on one `select()`-driven pulse loop. Immutable revisioned snapshots and
non-coalescing operation-ID commands cross typed worker boundaries; the older item,
scalar, and large-payload queues retain only bounded compatibility roles. MySQL or
MariaDB is the durable authority for snapshots, ledgers, current rows, inbox/results,
outbox state, migration history, and lifecycle evidence. Redis is optional and limited
to reconstructible caches plus validated world-recovery generations. See the full
[architecture guide](docs/reference/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [database guide](docs/reference/DATABASE.md).

## Quick start

The maintained setup path is Debian/Ubuntu, matching the CI workflow and the
repository's build-dependency manifest.

### Docker alternative

Docker Compose provides a complete local deployment without installing the
compiler or MariaDB on the host. It builds Duris, creates a private MariaDB
service, loads the fresh schema, applies immutable migrations, imports the
tracked help content, generates a persistent self-signed local TLS certificate,
and starts the full world:

```bash
./scripts/init_docker_env.sh
docker compose --env-file .env.docker up --build --detach --wait
curl http://127.0.0.1:4050/health
nc 127.0.0.1 4000
```

The generated `.env.docker` is ignored, mode `0600`, and contains random
database credentials. The database, filesystem-backed player state, recovery
journals, backups, certificate, and logs live in named Docker volumes and
survive ordinary container rebuilds.
This stack is a local/development alternative to the native setup below; it is
not the production deployment model. See the [Docker deployment guide](docs/operations/DOCKER.md)
for lifecycle, configuration, upgrades, logs, and data-reset commands.

After setup, one command builds every maintained target and runs the complete
non-database regression gate:

```bash
make test-all
```

Run the isolated Docker/MySQL migration and schema suites separately with
`make test-db`; Docker is an optional prerequisite for that database gate.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install equivs
make build-deps-package
sudo apt install ./bin/packages/duris-build-deps_1.0_all.deb
```

`equivs` is only the bootstrap tool used to build the metapackage. The manifest
then installs Git, Python, dos2unix, the compiler, GNU Make, GDB, Valgrind,
clang-format, MariaDB-compatible client and server packages, and the XML,
compression, TLS, JSON, Redis, BSD, libcurl (SMTP), and MySQL/MariaDB
development libraries required by the repository. The compiler supplies the
ASan/UBSan runtimes used by the sanitizer build. Redis itself is optional, and so
is the SMTP relay: account password recovery by email stays off unless
`MAIL_ENABLED=TRUE` is set in `.env`.

On another Linux distribution, use
[`packaging/duris-build-deps.equivs`](packaging/duris-build-deps.equivs) as the
authoritative dependency list.

### 2. Configure the server

```bash
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
```

Edit `.env` and set the explicit environment role, listener address, database
host/port, user, password, name, and exact `DB_ALLOWED_TARGETS` entry. There are
no database credential defaults. The server rejects a `.env` that is not an
owner-controlled regular file with mode `0600` or stricter. It loads this file
at boot, and the migration scripts use the same values. `.env` is ignored by
Git and must never be committed. See the
[configuration reference](docs/operations/CONFIGURATION.md) for precedence, Redis
recovery, proxy handling, and diagnostic switches.

Set `REDIS=TRUE` with `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, and an explicit `REDIS_DB` to enable
caches and recovery integration. Local development may use shared
`REDIS_USERNAME`/`REDIS_PASSWORD` ACL authentication. Production requires distinct world,
presence, cache, maintenance, and, when enabled, donation ACL identities. Verified
`REDIS_TLS=TRUE` transport applies to every runtime connection; non-loopback production
endpoints require TLS. `REDIS_WORLD_STATE=TRUE` additionally enables immutable world
recovery, which is off unless a server turns it on.
Player saves do not depend on Redis. If a DurisWeb backend will authenticate
through WebSocket or GMCP, give it a private `DURISWEB_SECRET` and follow the
challenge-response contract in the
[DurisWeb API reference](docs/reference/api/durisweb.md). Production browser
traffic must terminate TLS at a local reverse proxy. The remaining switches in
`.env.example` are documented inline and are intended primarily for local gameplay testing.

The local-development example enables external donation notices with
`REDIS_DONATION_SUBSCRIBER=TRUE`. Replace its local-only placeholder with an
independent HMAC key before connecting a publisher; see the
[donation event envelope](docs/reference/api/donation-events.md).

### 3. Create a development database

The following uses `duris_dev` as an example. Set that database name, the new
user password, and `DB_ALLOWED_TARGETS=127.0.0.1/duris_dev` explicitly in
`.env`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS duris_dev
  CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
  COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'duris'@'127.0.0.1'
  IDENTIFIED BY 'CHOOSE_A_PASSWORD';
ALTER USER 'duris'@'127.0.0.1'
  IDENTIFIED BY 'CHOOSE_A_PASSWORD';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON duris_dev.* TO 'duris'@'127.0.0.1';
```

Load the authoritative fresh-database baseline:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
MYSQL_PWD="$DB_PASSWD" mysql \
  --host="$DB_HOST" \
  --port="${DB_PORT:-3306}" \
  --user="$DB_USER" \
  "$DB_NAME" < migrations/bootstrap_multithread_safe.sql

# Record the exact sealed baseline, then apply immutable post-baseline steps.
python3 scripts/migration_runner.py adopt --kind fresh_bootstrap
python3 scripts/migration_runner.py run

# Confirm the exact runtime contract before first boot.
./migrations/verify_runtime_compatibility.sh

# Epic-zone gameplay data is separate from the sealed schema contract.
# Before first boot, inspect and apply the source-derived seed as documented in
# docs/operations/EPIC_ZONE_SEED.md (it handles the initially empty zones table).
python3 scripts/epic_zone_seed.py check

# Seed the tracked help and login content. Inspect the counts first, then
# confirm the live import when prompted.
./scripts/import_help_to_prod.sh --local --dry-run
./scripts/import_help_to_prod.sh --local
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `bootstrap_multithread_safe.sql` is for an empty database. To upgrade an
> existing populated database, back it up, restore a disposable development
> clone, and use a separate owner-readable configuration file that targets only
> that clone. Never test schema changes on a live database.

For a cloned legacy database, copy the local configuration into a temporary
mode-`0600` file, change `DB_NAME` and `DB_ALLOWED_TARGETS` to the clone, and run
the guarded legacy upgrade through `MIGRATION_ENV_FILE`:

```bash
migration_env=$(mktemp)
chmod 600 "$migration_env"
cp .env "$migration_env"
${EDITOR:-vi} "$migration_env"
MIGRATION_ENV_FILE="$migration_env" ./migrations/run_migration.sh
rm -f "$migration_env"
unset migration_env
```

To replace an allow-listed local/development database directly from a private
MySQL dump, use the guarded importer. It refuses active database connections,
creates an owner-only backup before mutation, translates MySQL 8's `0900`
collation and stale view definers for MariaDB, runs both migration layers, verifies
the runtime contract, and restores the backup automatically if any stage fails:

```bash
chmod 600 /path/to/legacy.sql
python3 scripts/import_legacy_dump.py \
  --env-file .env \
  --replace \
  /path/to/legacy.sql
```

The canonical game schema is still checked exactly. Non-runtime tables from a
combined game/website dump may coexist and are preserved, but they are not treated
as part of the game server's schema contract. When a launcher-era `server_reboots`
table contains values the canonical lifecycle schema cannot represent, its complete
raw rows remain in `legacy_import_server_reboots` before the runtime projection is
normalized. Likewise, when required uniqueness cleanup collapses duplicate legacy
item metadata, the complete source rows remain in corresponding
`legacy_import_player_*` archive tables.

For the complete source-to-destination map, safety model, audited reference-import
results, and recovery runbook, see
[Legacy Dump Import Guide](docs/persistence/LEGACY_DUMP_IMPORT.md).

The legacy runner is re-runnable, records verified baseline adoption, and checks
runtime schema compatibility before it succeeds. If any step fails, treat the
clone as partially migrated and restore it from the known backup before retrying.

### 4. Build and start

```bash
make
./scripts/start_mud.sh --dev
```

The root build places every compiled artifact below `bin/`: the staged server
is `bin/server/dms_new`, the editor is `bin/areas/editor/de`, and the
area-generation tools are under `bin/areas/tools/`. The startup supervisor
promotes the server to `bin/server/dms`, rotates prior executables under
`bin/server/history/`, regenerates combined `areas/world.*` files, applies
pending immutable migrations for an allow-listed local database, verifies the
exact runtime schema on every restart, and only then starts it. Production
startup performs the verification read-only; use the migration runbook to
upgrade production. Without a configured user service it runs in the
background and writes console output to `logs/duris-console.log`. The `--dev`
quick-start listener is port 4000 and cannot select the production runtime role.

Production deployments use the checked-in systemd service rather than the local
user service. Its installer requires an explicit production configuration check,
enables boot startup, and supervises every exit with an unlimited restart policy.
See [Production systemd service](docs/operations/RUNBOOK.md#production-systemd-service)
for installation and cutover instructions.

For a foreground development session on port 4000, use this instead of
`start_mud.sh`:

```bash
./scripts/cycle_mud.sh --dev
```

For a fast development boot using only the tracked world data in `areas_mini/`,
run:

```bash
./scripts/cycle_mud.sh --minimal
```

`--minimal` implies development mode and port 4000. It validates the minimal
dataset, skips full `areas/world.*` generation and full-world runtime systems,
but keeps the player load/save and critical-command pipelines available so a
configured test character can log in, play, and disconnect cleanly. Use
`./scripts/start_mud.sh --minimal` for the corresponding background launcher.

## Troubleshooting

If the server stops during boot, inspect `logs/log/status` and
`logs/duris-console.log`. The most common checks are:

- **MySQL initialization failed:** confirm `.env` values, that the selected
  database exists, and that the account can connect on `DB_HOST:DB_PORT`. The
  server logs the effective database target during boot and aborts when the
  required schema is missing.
- **Redis connection failed:** Redis is optional; set `REDIS=FALSE` or remove
  the setting to run without Redis caches and world recovery. Player checkpoints remain
  available through their local coordinator and journal. If Redis is required, check
  `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, and that the service is reachable.
- **Missing world files or tools:** run `make build-area-tools` followed by
  `make world`, then restart. Combined `areas/world.*` files are generated
  outputs and should not be edited by hand.
- **Port already in use:** choose a different development port, or stop the
  existing local instance. Keep development on a non-`7777` port.

Operational log locations and restart behavior are documented in the
[runbook](docs/operations/RUNBOOK.md).

## Connect

```bash
nc localhost 4000
```

| Listener | Standard start | `--dev` start |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Plain telnet | 7777 | 4000 |
| TLS telnet | 7778 | 4001 |
| WebSocket and HTTP health | 4050 | 4050 |

The WebSocket port can be overridden with `DURIS_WEBSOCKET_PORT`. Once the game is
running, `scripts/healthcheck.sh` verifies both process and database-pool readiness.

For local TLS, run `./scripts/generate_localhost_cert.sh`. It creates an ignored,
machine-local self-signed keypair under `certs/`; that fallback is accepted only
when `ENVIRONMENT=local` and `LISTEN_ADDRESS` is exactly `127.0.0.1` or `::1`.
For a networked deployment, provide the ignored root files `duris.crt` and
`duris.key`; every private key must be owned by the server user and mode `0600`
or stricter. Startup fails if that deployment certificate boundary is not met.

## Development workflow

Run the complete developer/CI gate before handing off a change:

```bash
make test-all
make test-db
```

`make test-all` covers maintained builds, generated world data, Python
regressions, and native tests. `make test-db` additionally creates disposable
MySQL containers for schema contracts, immutable migration checks, and the full
historical 145-step legacy upgrade, replay, fresh-bootstrap equivalence, and
runtime-compatibility test. It never targets the database configured in `.env`.

During development, run the smallest relevant regression directly:

```bash
make -C src
python3 tests/async/test_wear_all_regression.py
```

Tests under `tests/async/` are focused Python regression or source-contract
checks. The root harness generates required world data and runs these tests in
bounded parallel workers. Docker/MySQL suites remain an explicit `make test-db`
step, while externally provisioned migration checks must target a development
clone. See [Testing](docs/guides/TESTING.md) for target details and focused-test
controls.

Format only touched C/C++ lines so legacy diffs stay reviewable:

```bash
./scripts/format.sh
./scripts/format.sh --check
```

Install the repository's pre-commit hook with `./scripts/install-hooks.sh`.
Sanitizer and Valgrind workflows are covered in
[Building](docs/guides/BUILDING.md) and [Valgrind](docs/guides/valgrind.md).
