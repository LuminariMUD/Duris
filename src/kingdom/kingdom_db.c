/*
 *  kingdom_db.c
 *  Duris
 *
 *  Persistence for the kingdom realms: the four entry points declared at the
 *  foot of kingdom_internal.h, implemented once against MariaDB and once
 *  against the flat-file store.
 *
 *  WHY A COMPILE-TIME SPLIT AND NOT A RUNTIME ONE
 *  ---------------------------------------------
 *  persistence_mode_configure() refuses to boot a MariaDB-client build in
 *  flatfile-primary mode, refuses to boot a client-free build in
 *  mariadb-primary mode, and rejects the hybrid mode outright
 *  (src/persistence/persistence_mode.c:113-142). Exactly one store is
 *  reachable in any given binary, and persistence_mode_flatfile_root() is
 *  NULL under the default MariaDB build, so a flat-file-only store would
 *  silently not persist in production. The split is therefore the same
 *  __NO_MYSQL__ flag the Makefile sets for PERSISTENCE_BACKEND=flatfile
 *  (src/Makefile:42-51) rather than a runtime branch carrying a dead half.
 *
 *  WHAT IS PERSISTED
 *  -----------------
 *  One record per realm, eleven integers wide. THE TERRITORY IS A SINGLE
 *  INTEGER: because the claim order is fixed and a ring completes before the
 *  next opens, a realm owns claims 1..highest_claim and nothing else. So
 *  claiming a square, reverting an outer ring for arrears, and losing the
 *  whole realm are all one small integer write -- there is no per-square
 *  table and no 80-row rewrite anywhere in this file.
 *
 *  The anchor is stored as hall_vnum ONLY. hall_rnum, zone_idx and
 *  hall_x/hall_y are derived state; kingdom_db_load_all() deliberately leaves
 *  them at their "unresolved" defaults (hall_rnum 0, matching real_room0()'s
 *  sentinel) because resolving them needs a loaded world, and this module must
 *  be safe to load from before the world is up. kingdom_initialize() resolves
 *  the anchors and builds the square index after loading, exactly as its
 *  contract in kingdom.h says.

 *
 * Both backends reject per RECORD and never per store, and both log the
 * rejection -- but THE TWO END STATES ARE NOT THE SAME, and an operator
 * reading the log has to know which backend produced it:
 *
 *   MariaDB: the loader logs the row and skips it. Nothing on the load path
 *     deletes or rewrites a row it refused, so the corrupt row is still in
 *     kingdom_realms after the boot that rejected it: readable for forensics
 *     and repairable by hand, after which the next boot loads it. (Not
 *     immortal -- a later upsert for that same assoc_id, or
 *     kingdom_on_guild_deleted()'s DELETE, still replaces or removes it. The
 *     point is only that the REJECTION itself destroys nothing.)
 *
 *   Flat file: the decoder logs the record and drops it from the decoded
 *     catalogue, and every write republishes the whole authority file from
 *     that catalogue. So the FIRST publish after the drop -- any single-realm
 *     save, any flush -- writes the file without the record and ERASES IT
 *     FROM DISK for good. THE FLAT-FILE DROP IS DESTRUCTIVE AND THE SQL DROP
 *     IS NOT: copy the authority file aside before running a server that has
 *     logged one, or the evidence goes with the next write.
 *
 * Only the flat file's checksum, layout and assoc_id ordering fail the whole
 * load. Both save paths (single-record and flush) refuse to write a record
 * that fails this, leaving it dirty in memory. Losing one guild's territory
 * is the outcome in every case, rather than the process. */
