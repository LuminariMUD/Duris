/*
 *  kingdom_guards.c
 *  Duris
 *
 *  The realm's garrison: how many guards a territory entitles it to, where
 *  they stand, and the rung of the arrears ladder that takes them away and
 *  gives them back.
 *
 *  THE GARRISON IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED
 *  -------------------------------------
 *  Nothing in this file is persisted and no guard pointer outlives the call
 *  that made it. The realm record already says everything needed to rebuild
 *  the garrison from nothing -- highest_claim gives the land, hall_rnum gives
 *  the anchor, arrears says whether guards are permitted at all -- so the
 *  whole module is one idempotent reconciliation:
 *
 *      kingdom_guards_refresh(realm)
 *          work out the posts the realm should man RIGHT NOW,
 *          keep the guards already standing on them,
 *          extract the rest, spawn into the gaps.
 *
 *  That is also the answer to duplicates across a restart, but the two kinds
 *  of restart get there differently, and an earlier draft of this banner got
 *  the second one wrong. A COLD BOOT holds no guards -- no zone file loads
 *  them -- so the first refresh simply spawns the allowance. A COPYOVER is the
 *  opposite: copyover_save() writes EVERY living NPC to copyover.dat, guards
 *  included (write_mob_entry(), persistence/copyover.c:183-245), and
 *  copyover_recover() re-spawns each one via read_mobile() and copies back
 *  room, hp, gold and birthplace (persistence/copyover.c:1061-1199). What it
 *  does NOT copy back is this module's realm stamp: struct copyover_mob has no
 *  field for the npc value[] slots, and read_mobile() zeroes them on load
 *  (world/db.c:1970-1973), so last cycle's garrison comes back stamped 0 --
 *  guards of no realm -- while the next refresh musters the allowance afresh
 *  beside it. The orphan sweep in kingdom_guards_refresh_all() is what removes
 *  them: it despawns every guard-prototype mob whose stamp does not resolve to
 *  a live realm, stamp 0 explicitly included. Note the boot order in
 *  net/comm.c's boot sequence: kingdom_initialize() -- and therefore its
 *  refresh_all -- runs BEFORE copyover_recover() restores the old roster, so
 *  the sweep that clears it is the first refresh_all AFTER the recovery, not
 *  the boot-time one. If this file instead wrote its own roster down, every
 *  restart would either resurrect a stale roster on top of the fresh one or
 *  need this same reconciliation anyway -- so it keeps only the reconciliation
 *  and throws the roster away.
 *
 *  THE LADDER (ruled 2026-08-28, RULINGS.md "6 -- UPKEEP DEGRADATION")
 *  ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  kingdom_upkeep_event() moves `arrears` and does nothing else; its banner
 *  "THE LADDER IS STATE, NOT AN ERRAND" names kingdom_guard_allowance() as the
 *  place rung 1 is applied, so that is where it is applied -- once, in the
 *  function every caller already asks -- rather than privately inside the
 *  spawner where another caller could miss it.
 *
 *  CALLS THAT CAN FREE THEIR ARGUMENT
 *  ----------------------------------
 *  char_to_room() (world/handler.c:1119) and extract_char() (world/handler.c:4665)
 *  are both in that family: char_to_room() extracts an NPC outright when the
 *  target room is negative (world/handler.c:1136-1145), and extract_char()
 *  calls free_char() before it returns (world/handler.c:4994-5002). So every
 *  spawn here branches on char_to_room()'s RETURN VALUE and never on the
 *  character's state afterwards, and every despawn re-tests char_in_list()
 *  immediately before extracting -- the same guard char_to_room() itself uses
 *  after running a room proc (world/handler.c:1402).
 *
 *  Re-audited 2026-09-01, line by line through world/handler.c:1119-1406, and
 *  the answer is narrower than "it can free anything". Of char_to_room()'s
 *  FALSE returns only ONE frees the argument:
 *
 *    !IS_ALIVE(ch)        (:1131-1134) returns FALSE, frees nothing
 *    room < 0 && IS_NPC   (:1136-1145) extract_char()s and returns FALSE
 *                                      -- THE ONE FREEING PATH
 *    already in a room    (:1154-1160) returns FALSE, frees nothing
 *    room proc / sector   (:1397-1406 and below) FREE, but are UNREACHABLE
 *                                      from here: KINGDOM_GUARD_ENTRY_DIR is
 *                                      negative, so :1375-1378 has already
 *                                      returned TRUE before any of them run.
 *
 *  So the freeing path is guarded twice over -- kingdom_guard_valid_rnum()
 *  refuses a negative rnum before the call, and the failure branch still
 *  consults char_in_list() rather than the character -- and the post-call
 *  handling below is correct as written. char_in_list() (core/utility.c:568)
 *  only COMPARES the pointer against character_list and never dereferences it,
 *  which is what makes it safe to ask about a pointer that may already be
 *  freed; nothing is allocated between the free and the question, so the
 *  address cannot have been recycled under it either.
 *
 *  Sibling files inside src/kingdom/ are cited by FUNCTION NAME rather than by
 *  line, because they are being written alongside this one and a line number
 *  into them would be stale before it was read. Engine files outside this
 *  directory are stable and are cited file:line.

 * The mob a kingdom guard is loaded from: VMOB_KINGDOM_GUARD, declared in
 * kingdom_internal.h beside the harvest-node object vnums.
 *
 * IT IS NOT DEFINED HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. This file used to carry its
 * own #define of 97810 on the reasoning that the number sat inside the
 * builders' subsystem band in world/buildings.h and was unspent there. The
 * reasoning was sound and the number was still wrong, because "unspent in a
 * header's comment block" is not the same fact as "present in a .mob file",
 * and 97810 was in NO .mob file at all. read_mobile(97810, VIRTUAL) therefore
 * resolved real_mobile() to -1 and returned 0 (world/db.c:1930-1937), so every
 * spawn failed and the garrison never appeared -- silently, because that
 * particular log line is compiled out (see kingdom_guard_spawn_one()).
 *
 * The vnum now lives in the header because the .mob record and this loader
 * have to agree and one definition is the only way to keep them in step. It is
 * still deliberately NOT a tuning value: struct kingdom_config is frozen for
 * this change and has no field for a vnum, and a second reader of
 * lib/kingdom.cfg opened here would be a second place for the file's meaning
 * to drift.
 *
 * When the prototype is absent from the world the module simply fields no
 * guards -- the same state an operator produces with
 * kingdom.guards.per.squares set above 80 -- and says so once rather than once
 * per realm per upkeep cycle. That fallback is what MASKED the bad vnum, so it
 * is worth being explicit that it is a safety net and not a test: only
 * kingdom_guard_rnum() answering >= 0 against a real heavens.mob record proves
 * the number is right.
