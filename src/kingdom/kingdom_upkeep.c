/*
 *  kingdom_upkeep.c
 *  Duris
 *
 *  The periodic upkeep charge and the arrears ladder.
 *
 *  Every cycle a realm is billed COIN for each square it owns. Resources are
 *  deliberately not accepted here: they are non-withdrawable and spendable
 *  only on kingdom benefits (kingdom_internal.h), so letting them settle a
 *  debt would launder them back into the guild's liquid wealth.
 *
 *  THE LADDER (ruled 2026-08-28, RULINGS.md "6 -- UPKEEP DEGRADATION")
 *  ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  A missed cycle advances one rung, in this order:
 *
 *      KARR_CURRENT        -> KARR_GUARDS_GONE     guards despawn
 *                          -> KARR_NODES_DORMANT   harvest nodes go dormant
 *                          -> KARR_LAND_REVERTING  the OUTERMOST SQUARE
 *                                                  reverts, and one more per
 *                                                  further missed cycle
 *
 *  One square, not one ring (ruled 2026-09-05). A ring took eight to
 *  thirty-two squares for a single missed payment, which stripped a realm
 *  faster than any debt warrants; a square makes the ladder a slope the guild
 *  can feel and still climb back.
 *
 *  Paying halts the ladder wherever it has reached and restores the guards
 *  and the nodes -- but a square already reverted is GONE, and buying it back
 *  costs the full original price. That asymmetry is the whole point of the
 *  ruling, so kingdom_clear_arrears() never touches highest_claim. Losing a
 *  square also UNMAKES the champion, which answers only to a realm holding
 *  every square; retaking the eightieth lets the guild buy a new one.
 *
 *  The one place the rung clears WITHOUT a payment is the bottom of the
 *  ladder: when the last square reverts and highest_claim reaches 0 the realm
 *  owes nothing -- upkeep scales with squares held -- and no payment could
 *  ever clear the rung, so kingdom_apply_arrears() clears it itself. Leaving
 *  it set would have `kingdom claim` refuse with "settle the debt" over a debt
 *  of zero, wedging the realm out of the game for good.
 *
 *  THE LADDER IS STATE, NOT AN ERRAND
 *  ----------------------------------
 *  Nothing here hunts down guard mobs or switches nodes off. The realm record
 *  is the single authority -- exactly as the territory is the single integer
 *  highest_claim -- so this file only moves `arrears`, and the guard and
 *  harvest code reads it. That is the contract the rest of the module is
 *  written against:
 *
 *      nodes   yield             only while realm.arrears <  KARR_NODES_DORMANT
 *                                (kingdom_nodes_dormant(), kingdom_harvest.c,
 *                                 is exactly that test)
 *      guards  are permitted     only while realm.arrears <  KARR_GUARDS_GONE
 *                                (kingdom_guard_allowance(), kingdom_guards.c,
 *                                 applies it)
 *
 *  Keeping it as state makes "restore on payment" free: clearing the rung
 *  restores both, with no bookkeeping of which mob stood where. It also means
 *  the ladder gates expansion for nothing -- kingdom_claim_next() refuses
 *  `kingdom claim` while arrears != KARR_CURRENT and something is owed, so
 *  clearing the rung is what reopens buying land.
 *
 *  DORMANT REALMS ARE NOT BILLED
 *  -----------------------------
 *  A realm is DORMANT when its anchor will not resolve (hall_rnum 0). Since
 *  kingdom_resolve_anchor() requires the association's own MAIN guildhall to
 *  stand on the persisted hall_vnum, that covers a hall destroyed, demoted to
 *  outposts or moved elsewhere, as well as a vnum that no longer names a map
 *  room and a row inherited by a reused association id and not yet audited.
 *  Dormancy is sticky: nothing re-anchors a realm until a main hall stands on
 *  its square again.
 *
 *  A dormant realm owns no squares in the index, cannot claim and cannot
 *  abandon. kingdom_upkeep_due() answers 0 for it, and the sweep skips it --
 *  telling the guild once per cycle that the realm lies dormant -- WHATEVER
 *  it holds on paper, including nothing at all. Nothing about its state is
 *  touched: not the rung, not missed_cycles, not upkeep_paid_through. A debt
 *  outstanding when the hall fell is still owed when one stands again, and a
 *  landless dormant realm keeps whatever rung it was on rather than being
 *  quietly returned to KARR_CURRENT by the owes-nothing branch below.
 *
 *  Because upkeep_paid_through is left where it was, the first sweep after the
 *  hall stands again finds the paid period long expired and bills ONE cycle's
 *  upkeep straight away -- one charge, not one per period of dormancy -- and
 *  re-stamps the paid mark to that moment. A realm that cannot pay it takes a
 *  single rung, counted from wherever the ladder already stood.
 *
 *  CADENCE AND CRASHES
 *  -------------------
 *  Two clocks matter here, and both survive a reboot:
 *
 *    WHEN a realm is next billed derives from its PERSISTED
 *    upkeep_paid_through -- a realm is due once a full period has passed
 *    since it last paid. The in-memory cycle stamp below only throttles the
 *    sweep; it decides nothing about who owes. So the first sweep after a
 *    boot does not re-bill realms that paid shortly before the restart.
 *
 *    WHAT a payment took is written when it is taken, by
 *    kingdom_persist_payment(), and the guarantee differs by build mode:
 *
 *      MariaDB    the debited guild and the realm's paid mark are written
 *                 inside ONE transaction, or neither is written. No crash
 *                 can keep one without the other. When the transaction
 *                 cannot be opened, or either write or the commit fails,
 *                 nothing is left written: the realm is marked
 *                 payment_pending, the debit stands in memory, the generic
 *                 flush withholds the record and the sweep stops billing
 *                 the realm until kingdom_upkeep_retry_pending() lands the
 *                 pair. A crash while pending loses the in-memory debit, so
 *                 the realm is billed again for the same period -- the safe
 *                 direction.
 *
 *      flat-file  the guild and realm catalogues are after-images in one
 *                 recovery journal. The journal lands before either image;
 *                 an interruption after one is installed is completed at the
 *                 next authority access. A failed commit marks the realm
 *                 payment_pending for retry.
 *
 *    THE PENDING RULE. A paid mark must never reach disk without its debit,
 *    and kingdom_db_save_realm() is a primitive that cannot enforce that for
 *    itself: kingdom_persist_payment() is precisely the caller that must be
 *    allowed to publish a pending record, because it writes the guild in the
 *    same breath. So the obligation falls on every OTHER caller. Each
 *    kingdom_db_save_realm() outside kingdom_db.c and kingdom_persist_payment()
 *    -- the default write at the end of the sweep below, kingdom_rehome_realm()
 *    in kingdom.c after a hall change, the abandon path in kingdom_claim.c --
 *    has to test realm.payment_pending first and, when it is set, write
 *    nothing and leave the record DIRTY. The change it wanted to save is in
 *    the record either way, and kingdom_upkeep_retry_pending() carries the
 *    record to disk with its guild when the pair lands. An unguarded writer
 *    would publish the pending realm's paid mark (and any raised
 *    highest_claim) over a treasury that still shows the coin -- the exact
 *    half-state payment_pending exists to prevent. Both backends'
 *    kingdom_db_flush_dirty() skip pending records for the same reason, and
 *    the flat-file realm write is never attempted before the guild's has
 *    succeeded.
 *
 *    A DEFAULT (a rung advanced, a ring reverted) moves no coin, so it is
 *    written on its own the moment it is applied, and a failed write leaves
 *    the record dirty for the next flush. Deposits and the other non-payment
 *    changes that only set `dirty` are flushed on EVERY tick, not just at the
 *    sweep -- see kingdom_upkeep_event() -- so they wait at most one tick
 *    rather than one billing period to reach disk.
 *
 *  Sibling files inside src/kingdom/ are cited by FUNCTION NAME rather than by
 *  line: they are still being written alongside this one, so a line number
 *  into them would be stale before it was read. Engine files outside this
 *  directory are stable and are cited by line.
 *
 *  PERIODIC-JOB DISCIPLINE
 *  -----------------------
 *  kingdom_upkeep_event() is a periodic-registry callback. A callback cannot
 *  be preempted and "heavy jobs must expose bounded slices instead of hiding
 *  an unbounded sweep inside one invocation" (docs/reference/EVENTS.md:158-159),
 *  so this one is bounded by the realm count -- at most MAX_ASC (999,
 *  guild/assocs.h:23) and in practice a handful, since a realm needs an
 *  81-square footprint and Chebyshev-10 clearance from every other. Per realm
 *  the work is a hash lookup, integer arithmetic and at most one coin
 *  deduction; no world traversal and no allocation. The single 80-step path
 *  (rebuilding the square index after a ring reverts) fires only for a realm
 *  that has already missed three consecutive cycles.
 *
 *  The sweep walks a snapshot of the association ids rather than the map's
 *  iterators, which is the discipline EVENTS.md:185-186 asks of every periodic
 *  scan: "stable cursors or runtime-ID snapshots so entity removal between
 *  slices cannot invalidate traversal state".
 *
 *  It deliberately does NOT call nevent_periodic_continue_after() or
 *  nevent_periodic_next_after(): both panic via panic_corruption() when there
 *  is no periodic job running (world/nevent_periodic.c:342-358), so either
 *  would turn a non-periodic caller -- a test, an immortal command -- into a
 *  crash.
 *
 *  Registration is the wiring lane's job; this file only provides the
 *  callback.
