 * Telnet adapter for account password recovery by email: the '?' entry at the
 * account password prompt and the CON_ACCT_RESET_* handlers.  This file owns
 * every prompt, the per-descriptor attempt counter and the pending-hash field;
 * the core (account_recovery.c) owns tokens, cooldowns and mail.
 *
 * The reset code is only ever INPUT here.  No output, log line or copy carries
 * it beyond d->account_recovery_code, which is cleansed on every exit path.
