/*
 * sql_pool.h — MySQL connection pool for async persistence workers.
 *
 * Replaces the single persistenceDB connection shared by
 * 3 persistence worker threads with a fixed-size pool (default 4).
 * Each worker acquires a connection, executes its query, and releases
 * it back — eliminating the persistence_sql_mutex bottleneck and
 * allowing concurrent MySQL queries across worker threads.
 *
 * Thread safety: all public functions are internally synchronized.
