/*
 * Per-thread client-library setup for the persistence workers.
 *
 * MySQL 8's client refuses mysql_thread_init() until mysql_library_init() has
 * run; MariaDB Connector/C initialises itself on demand and never needs it.
 * Every worker here treats a failed mysql_thread_init() as "give up and exit",
 * so against a MySQL 8 client the workers returned before draining anything and
 * the queue simply stopped -- silently, because a worker that never started has
 * no connection to report the failure on.
 *
 * Bring the library up exactly once, whichever client is linked.  Callers keep
 * their own handling of a genuine per-thread failure.
