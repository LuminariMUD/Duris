/*
 * OVERVIEW -- where this file sits in the ship system
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * The ship subsystem's toolbox.  Nothing here drives gameplay on its own;
 * every other ship_*.c file leans on this one.  If you are new to the ship
 * code, read this file second, after ships.h.
 *
 * Map of the ship subsystem
 * -------------------------
 *   ships.h          all shared types, constants and SHIP_*() accessor macros
 *   ship_variables.c the static data tables (hull classes, weapons, crews,
 *                    chiefs, ports) -- pure data, no logic
 *   ship_utils.c     THIS FILE: the ship registry, the tactical map and
 *                    contact list, geometry, crew mechanics, slot mechanics,
 *                    messaging, and the cargo jettison/salvage helpers
 *   ship_base.c      ship lifecycle: create, name, lay out rooms, load, save,
 *                    delete, dock, sink, fly; plus the per-tick ship_activity()
 *   ship_control.c   the helm: the control panel and its player commands
 *   ship_combat.c    firing, ramming, damage, sinking, frags
 *   ship_cargo.c     the commodity market, contraband and customs
 *   ship_shop.c      the shipwright and crew-hall shopkeepers
 *   ship_npc.c       spawning and running NPC ships and their crew mobs
 *   ship_npc_ai.c    the NPC ship brain (struct NPCShipAI)
 *   ship_auto.c      the player autopilot ("order sail")
 *   ship_identity.c  process-local ship handles that survive ship deletion
 *
 * The three global scratch buffers
 * --------------------------------
 * Three module-level arrays are shared by the whole subsystem and are only
 * valid until the next call that rebuilds them.  Never hold an index or a
 * pointer into one across a call that might refill it:
 *
 *   tactical_map[101][101]  backing storage for the 100x100 populated patch
 *                           around one ship. Rebuilt by getmap() at 0..99.
 *   contacts[MAXSHIPS]      the ships visible from one ship, in map order.
 *                           Rebuilt by getcontacts().  This is the array that
 *                           every "target <n>" command indexes into.
 *   local_buf               the act_to_*() formatting buffer.
 *
 * Coordinate conventions
 * ----------------------
 * ShipData::x, ::y are the ship's own indices into tactical_map, normally
 * (50, 50) -- the centre.  The map's y axis is inverted with respect to
 * compass north, so cell lookups read tactical_map[x][100 - y].  Bearings and
 * headings are compass degrees (0 = north, 90 = east), kept in [0, 360) by
 * normalize_direction().  ShipData::z is altitude and is non-zero only for
 * flying ships.
 *
 * Two indexing conventions that trip people up
 * --------------------------------------------
 *   - ship_type_data[] is subscripted by the 0-based SHIP_CLASS()/m_class,
 *     but each entry's own _classid field is 1-BASED.  See get_hull_mod().
 *   - ShipRuntimeRef::slot (ship_identity.c) is likewise 1-based, so that 0
 *     can mean "no identity".
 *
 * Ownership of returned strings
 * -----------------------------
 * Several helpers here return a pointer to a static or member buffer that the
 * next call overwrites -- get_status_str(), get_description(), crew_bonuses().
 * Each says so in its own comment.  Print them; do not store them.
