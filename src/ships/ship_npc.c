 *
 * NPC ships: what they are made of and how they appear
 *****************************************************/

/*
 * OVERVIEW -- where this file sits in the ship system
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * The CONTENT half of NPC shipping: the names, fit-outs, crew rosters and
 * spawn rules for pirates, hunters, escorts and the two unique ships.  The
 * BEHAVIOUR half -- how an NPC ship decides where to sail and when to shoot
 * -- is ship_npc_ai.c (struct NPCShipAI).  If you are changing what a pirate
 * carries, you are in the right file; if you are changing what it does, you
 * are not.
 *
 * The file reads top to bottom in four banded sections:
 *
 *   NAMES    pirateShipNames[], and is_npc_ship_name(), which stops players
 *            naming their own ship after one
 *   SETUP    45 setup_npc_<class>_<nn>() fit-out functions, indexed by the
 *            npcShipSetup[] table at the end of the section
 *   LOADING  the spawn path, from the ambush roll down to a crewed ship
 *   CREWS    npcShipCrewData[], the crew mob rosters, and the two unique
 *            ships (Cyric's Revenge and the disabled zone ship)
 *
 * Fit-outs and the npcShipSetup[] table
 * -------------------------------------
 * Each setup_npc_*() function is pure data expressed as code: it mounts
 * weapons, sets the three crew skills, and rolls the ship's frag value (which
 * is what a player earns for sinking it).  npcShipSetup[] then binds each one
 * to a hull class, a difficulty LEVEL (0-4) and a crew size.
 *
 * To add an NPC ship: write a setup function, add one npcShipSetup[] row.
 * Nothing else needs to change -- find_ship_setup() picks uniformly from the
 * rows matching the requested level, class and minimum speed.
 *
 * How a pirate finds you
 * ----------------------
 *   try_load_pirate_ship(target)   the ambush roll, from the AI's sweep.
 *                                  Scales threat off hull weight + frags, so
 *                                  a big notorious ship draws worse trouble.
 *                                  Refuses against small hulls, other NPC
 *                                  ships, and during ocean PvP.
 *     -> try_load_npc_ship(target, type, level)    pick a spawn point 45 map
 *                                  rooms off the target's bow
 *       -> try_load_npc_ship(..., location)        require open ocean; prefer
 *                                  a hull fast enough to keep up
 *         -> load_npc_ship()       create, name, load, fit out, crew, undock
 *           -> create_npc_ship()   allocate + attach an NPCShipAI
 *           -> load_npc_ship_crew() staff it from npcShipCrewData[]
 *
 * Difficulty level drives both the fit-out and the brain: level 3+ always
 * gets the advanced AI, level 2 half the time, level 1 one time in five.
 *
 * Crews and the reward for boarding
 * ---------------------------------
 * npcShipCrewData[] holds one roster per level: a captain, a first mate,
 * specialists, two pools of grunts, and a treasure chest with its key.
 * load_npc_ship_crew() fills berths in that order of importance, so a small
 * crew still gets the mobs that matter.  The chest goes aboard and the key
 * goes on the captain -- that pairing is the point of boarding an NPC ship.
 *
 * NPC ships are never persisted
 * -----------------------------
 * They have no owner, no anchor and no database row; queue_ship_save()
 * ignores them.  They are created on demand and deleted outright by
 * try_unload_npc_ship() (or by finish_sinking(), which does NOT downgrade
 * them to a sloop the way it does a player ship).
 *
 * The two unique ships
 * --------------------
 *   Cyric's Revenge  live.  A demon ship special-cased throughout the
 *                    subsystem: a fifth of the usual frags, a very long sink
 *                    timer so the wreck can be looted, mindblast resistance,
 *                    and a nexus stone aboard as the prize.
 *   the zone ship    disabled; see the banner in the CREWS section.
