"""Source contracts for character persistence, load, and death recovery.

Pins these previously repaired boundaries:
  1. new characters take the synchronous first save that INSERTs into player_data
  2. a failed terminal death save schedules recovery that completes extraction
  3. item extra descriptions and affects are deleted before being re-inserted
  4. the typed load path reports why it refused a character
  5. display_account_menu tolerates a NULL argument
  6. enter_game converts fallback room vnums before indexing the mini world
