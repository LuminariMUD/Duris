"""A failed ship save forgets the row id only when that save created the row.

sql_save_ship() inserts a new ship's `ships` row and then writes its armour, crew
and slot rows in one batch, all in one transaction.  When the batch or the commit
fails, the transaction is rolled back.  For a new ship that removes the row the
save just inserted, so the ship must go back to `db_id == -1` and insert again
next time.

The failure paths reset `db_id` for every ship, including one whose row already
existed.  The next save then took the insert path, collided with
`UNIQUE(owner_name)` and failed, and every later save failed the same way until
reboot (shutdown_ships() then treats that as corruption).  The commit-failure path
had the opposite defect: a new ship kept the id of a row that was rolled back, so
later saves updated a row that did not exist.

A failed COMMIT is not always a rollback, though: the server can apply it and
lose the reply.  Forgetting the new row's id then left a stored row the ship no
longer knew, and every later save collided with it.  So a new ship whose COMMIT
fails keeps its id marked unconfirmed, and its next save looks for the row
before choosing between update and insert.

This runs the real sql_save_ship() and its batch helpers against a scripted
database that enforces `UNIQUE(owner_name)`, with a COMMIT that is either
rejected and rolled back or applied with its reply lost.
