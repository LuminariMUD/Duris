"""Source contracts for the kingdom module.

Every check here pins an invariant that was actually broken (or nearly
shipped broken) while the module was built, so each is a regression guard
for a defect class with a body count, not a style preference:

  * the OUTWARD lifecycle hooks were once wired to nothing, so a deleted
    guild's realm was inherited by the next guild on the reused id and
    guard NPCs kept a dangling assoc pointer;
  * the map glyph table is indexed by its enum, so an entry added to one
    but not the other silently shifts every glyph after it;
  * the command table's name array INDEX is the command number, and the
    attributes file must gain an entry per command (its own test enforces
    the latter; this one pins the index arithmetic);
  * the SQL loader reads its row positionally from ONE column string, so
    token i of that string must be the field the loader assigns from row[i]
    and the i-th value the upsert supplies -- those are the load-bearing
    pairs; the migration is cross-checked as a third leg;
  * the boot, shutdown and upkeep wiring each had a stretch of life as
    exported-but-never-called dead code;
  * a treasury debit and the realm record that explains it were once two
    unrelated writes, so a crash between them either forgave a cycle or
    billed it twice;
  * two writers then bypassed the payment_pending guard that was added to fix
    that, so a hall move or an abandon published a paid mark whose debit was
    still only in memory -- THE PENDING-WRITE RULE below pins the guard at
    every call site, and the enumeration of call sites with it;
  * dormancy was not sticky: "hall_vnum still names a map room" is not "a
    hall still stands there", so any verb that re-resolved an anchor quietly
    re-anchored a realm that should have been dormant, and with the anchor
    came its billing, its garrison and its right to claim;
  * `help kingdom` found nothing in game: lib/information/help_index carried
    no kingdom entry at all, and the flat catalog's private alias for the long
    file masked the gap from the flat build -- so the two help paths disagreed
    about a topic that existed on only one of them.

Pure source checks: no server, no database. Pins are made against CODE:
comments are stripped before any body is searched, so a pin can never be
satisfied by prose describing the call it wants.

       keyword inside a longer one, or `help kingdom` still shows no help.

       2, and the pages title comparison is case-insensitive -- so an index
