"""End-to-end contracts for the offline bin/tools/pfile scanner.

The scanner links only skills.c and files.c out of the server tree and fills
the rest in with pfile-stubs.c, so link stubs and `_PFILE_` macro arms rot
silently: the tool keeps compiling while producing nothing at runtime.  These
tests exercise the two paths that rot.
