"""Contracts for the findings the warning-cleanup project recorded but deferred.

Each item below was a pre-existing defect noticed while resolving a compiler
warning, and each was left alone at the time because fixing it changes behavior
rather than tidying code.  They are repaired now; these contracts keep them
repaired.  See docs/guides/BUILDING.md ("Warning profile") for the compiler policy the
cleanup established, and docs/reference/CODEBASE.md for the conventions it enforces.
