"""A hull purchase checks the room pool, and never sells a second ship.

Two gaps around a full ship-room pool:

- A hull upgrade freed the ship's rooms in reset_ship() and then ignored a
  failed set_ship_physical_layout(), so upgrading into a nearly full pool left
  a loaded ship with no rooms.
- A ship the pool could not hold at boot stayed stored but out of the world,
  so its owner could buy another.  That ship's first save then collided with
  the stored one on UNIQUE(owner_name) and kept failing, and the purchase was
  lost at the next reboot.

This runs the real ship_hull_purchase_committed() and refuse_for_stored_ship().
The room check (ship_rooms_fit_class()) and stored-ship placement
(place_stored_ship()) are stubbed here; test_ship_boot_room_pool_full.py runs
them for real.  An upgrade that does not fit is refunded and changes nothing.
A first-ship purchase by an owner with a stored ship brings that ship back, or
is refused while there is no room, and is refunded either way.  buy_hull()
refuses both before any epic transaction starts.
