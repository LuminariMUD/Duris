"""Every persistence worker must bring the client library up before using it.

MySQL 8's client refuses mysql_thread_init() until mysql_library_init() has run.
MariaDB Connector/C initialises on demand and never needs it, so a MariaDB
development box cannot see the problem at all. Every worker in this tree treats
a failed mysql_thread_init() as "give up and exit", and a worker that never
started has no connection to report on -- so against a MySQL 8 client the save,
load, maintenance, outbox and locker queues stopped draining in silence.

Pin two things: the raw call is not reachable outside the shared helper, and the
helper still initialises the library exactly once.
