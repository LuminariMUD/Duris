"""A player save saves the ship the player owns, not the one they stand in.

do_save_silent() also saves the character's ship.  It found that ship with
get_ship_from_char(), which returns whatever ship the character is standing
in.  A checkpoint therefore queued a save for someone else's ship, or an NPC
ship, and not for the owner's own ship while the owner was ashore.  The
fallback branch (a character without a pid, or a terminal save type) wrote
that ship synchronously and reported failure when the write failed.
write_ship() always refuses NPC ships, so standing aboard one failed the save
even though the character had been written.

This runs the real do_save_silent() against a fake ship registry.  Both
branches now use the loaded player ship the character owns.  The fallback
branch still reports a failed write of that ship, as
test_deferred_save_flush.py requires.  get_ship_from_char() is deliberately
not defined here.
