"""A locker is saved with the character inside it.

writeCharacter() runs the locker's post-save hook, which saves the locker its occupant
is in and applies the locker's idle rule. Queued saves (the 30-second checkpoint, every
terminal save and writeCharacter()'s own queued branch) returned before it, so a locker
was saved only when its occupant walked out: what a player dropped in it was lost if
the session ended inside (shutdown, idle rent, link loss) or the server crashed. Each
queued save now runs the hook. The locker slot keeps the user by pid and the locker
by name, since a terminal save's caller extracts the user straight after.
