"""Exercise the flat-file half of src/kingdom/kingdom_db.c.

The MariaDB half is reached by the server's own boot; the __NO_MYSQL__ half
was, until this test, compiled by CI and executed by nothing. The harness
links kingdom_db.c against the real flatfile_store.c under a temporary root
and drives save, load, delete and flush through merge cases, whole-file
rejections (bad magic, unknown version, zero revision, an over-cap record
count, a broken checksum, a truncated payload) and the per-record drop on
both sides: the flush skipping one insane record of a batch, and
decode_catalog() dropping one insane on-disk record from an otherwise-sound
catalogue that then heals at the next publish.
Modelled on test_flatfile_nexus_repository.py.
