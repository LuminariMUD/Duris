"""Drive a kingdom's workshops and guild store through a real flat-file server.

This boots the FULL world (a kingdom needs the overhead map and the guildhall
zone, neither of which the minimal world has), so `make world` must have been
run first. A disposable character named Workswarden is created and raised to
OVERLORD while the server is down, as creation refuses the god_list names that
once did this. That lets the journey found a guild, go where it needs to, and
load the harvest nodes a realm would otherwise take days to find. Its coins
come from a pile a zone reset places in a room, because coins a god conjures
are refused by the currency path.

The journey founds a guild with Workswarden as leader, finds a legal realm seat with
`kingdom prospect`, raises a main hall there and converts the guild to a
kingdom. With too little in the treasury it is refused a forge, and checks
that nothing was built and nothing charged. It funds the treasury, is refused
a store before any workshop and a second forge, and builds a forge and a store
(checking the treasury paid for both). Before any harvest the store refuses a
purchase the realm's stores cannot supply, taking nothing. It harvests mineral
and wood into the realm, then in the store lists and buys a pair of
vambraces. It checks they were made at level 56 (Workswarden is above the cap) with
the level-56 armour class and strength, that they are CRAFTED and STOREITEM
but neither SOULBIND nor NOSELL, that they are worth 5,800 copper -- a tenth of
the 58p they cost -- that their keywords carry neither the buyer's name nor the
maker's mark (the mark lives in the action description, where no command
reaches it, and a name there would answer to `get workswarden` wherever the piece
lay), that the realm's stores fell by exactly the bill, and that Workswarden's
platinum fell by the price while the treasury did not rise.

Then who may wear it. Anyone may carry, loot or sell store gear, but only its
buyer may WEAR it (ruled 2026-09-17). Workswarden wears the piece, takes it off, puts
it in a basket and leaves the basket for two characters on other accounts --
one NAMED "Vambraces", a word on the piece, and one with an ordinary name. Each
sheds its starter kit (a new character starts over its carrying limit), takes
the piece out of the basket, is refused the wear, and puts it back.

The journey's own copy of lib/kingdom.cfg sets the build costs to 1,000
platinum and the material scale to a quarter, so the realm needs a minute of
harvesting rather than several; the price scale stays as designed.
