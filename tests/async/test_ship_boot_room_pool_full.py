"""Booting more ships than the ship-room pool holds leaves no broken ship behind.

Ship interiors come from a fixed pool of rooms, 60003..64999.  Once SQL boot
loaded every ship row instead of the first 512, a large enough `ships` table
could run the pool dry: 700 frigates need 6,300 rooms and the pool has 4,997.
Every ship past that point failed load_ship(), and three things went wrong:

- set_ship_physical_layout() kept the rooms it had claimed before running out,
  so they were lost to every other ship for the life of the process;
- sql_load_all_ships() logged the failure but left the ship registered;
- the ship still carried LOADED from its saved flags, with no rooms, so an
  orderly shutdown read world[real_room(-1)] in shutdown_ships().

This runs the real sql_load_all_ships(), load_ship(), set_ship_physical_layout()
and shutdown_ships(), with the real ship registry, over 700 persisted frigates
and two sloops, under AddressSanitizer.  Rooms are now claimed all or nothing,
a ship that cannot be placed is destroyed (its row is kept), LOADED is cleared
before placement, and shutdown skips rooms a ship never got.  The first sloop
fits in the two rooms the frigates leave, which it could not when a failed
frigate kept them.

The ships left out are noted, and retry_unplaced_ships() brings them back as
rooms free up; ship_rooms_fit_class() tells a hull change whether the pool can
hold it.
