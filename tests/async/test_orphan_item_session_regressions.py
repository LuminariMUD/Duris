"""Regressions for the defects found in the 2026-08-29 minimal-boot Memcheck sweep.

The sweep's headline finding was an orphan `player_items` row - a payload row the
ownership ledger had never heard of - which made the owning character permanently
unloadable. The load path was made tolerant of that separately; these are the
remaining defects the same session turned up, each of which is a source contract
rather than a runtime check because the code paths need a live world.

1. do_load handed a wizard-created object straight over with obj_to_char() and
   submitted no transfer, so it arrived carrying a uid with no ledger row. That is
   how the orphan was created in the first place.
2. extract_obj() deliberately does not retire the ledger row; the reasoning and explicit
   operator-repair requirement have to stay written down or someone will "fix" it onto a
   teardown path or falsely promise that a snapshot save repairs custody authority.
3. generate_modif() leaked its scratch copy and generate_desc() dropped every
   string its helpers returned - once per descriptor in the game, via ztestdesc.
4. free_char() released every player string except long_descr, so each login that
   set one leaked it.
5. do_build() leaked the Building it declined to keep.
6. The world prototype files stay open while the game runs, then close during
   final world teardown after object instantiation has ended.
