"""Regression test for the game loop's latency instrumentation.

Three defects made the tick diagnostics lie about where time went:

1. Every section was timed with clock(), which on POSIX reports CPU time summed
   across every thread in the process.  The MySQL worker pool and the Redis
   subscriber burned CPU concurrently with the tick, so their time landed in the
   loop's own numbers and produced "MUD TICK TOOK TOO LONG - loop time -
   1.310889 / aff/pts time - 1.289582" reports for ticks that never stalled.
2. connections/commands/prompts/activities/combat were derived from the
   PROFILE_START/PROFILE_END accumulators, which only move when `do_profile` is
   on.  With profiling off -- the normal case -- those five lines of the stall
   report were stale garbage, which is why aff/pts (one of the two sections
   timed directly) always looked like the culprit.
3. The periodic latency dump wrote to the absolute path
   /durismud/logs/latency_trace.log, so no trace file was ever produced from a
   checkout that does not live at /durismud.

Verifies the loop times itself against CLOCK_MONOTONIC and dumps into logs/.
