"""The Ship Damage Control epic skill reduces damage to its owner's ship.

SKILL_SHIP_DAMAGE_CONTROL is an epic reward taught by the headless commodore
(mob 2733): the first lesson costs 240 epic points and 16,000 platinum, and
Chaos starter characters are granted it.  Its help entry promises
that the captain's ship "endures blows that would send lesser hulls to the
bottom".  Its only call sites, in damage_sail() and damage_hull(), had been
commented out, so the skill did nothing.

This runs the real epic_ship_damage_control(), damage_sail() and damage_hull():
with the owner aboard, a skill of 100 removes 24% of each hit; without the owner
aboard, or without the skill, the full damage lands.
