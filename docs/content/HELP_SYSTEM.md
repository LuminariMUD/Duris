# Help System

How in-game help works end to end: source material, import pipeline, and
runtime serving.

## Runtime path (what players see)

The `help` command (`do_help`, `src/cmd/actinf.c`) does two things:

1. **`wiki_help()`** (`src/cmd/wikihelp.c`) - in database-backed mode, searches
   an in-memory catalog of the `pages` table (`help_cache_get()`). A background
   worker loads the catalog after boot and refreshes it every 60 seconds; the
   command itself never queries the database, and until the first catalog is
   published it answers that help is temporarily unavailable. Operation,
   limits and the staff refresh command are in
   [help-cache.md](../operations/help-cache.md).

   Titles match case-insensitively by substring, with `%` and `_` wildcards
   (`WIKIHELP_RESULTS_LIMIT` is 100, `src/cmd/wikihelp.h`). One match renders
   the full entry; multiple matches render the exact match plus "see also"
   links. Misses are logged to `lib/etc/help`
   (`logit(LOG_HELP, ...)`), which is useful for spotting missing topics.
   Entries are stored wiki-formatted; `dewikify()` converts `[[...]]` markup
   into ANSI-colored output. There is no browsing cooldown.

   Two page features are applied at render time (`src/cmd/wikihelp.c`,
   `wiki_help_single()`):

   - **Redirects**: a row with `category_id` 1 whose text starts with
     `Redirect: <target>` is followed to `<target>`.
   - **Dynamic sections**: rows with certain `category_id`s get content
     appended from code/properties, not from stored text: 25 race (classes,
     racial stats, innates), 9 class (allowed races, innates, specs),
     16 spec (races, innates, skills, spells), 10 class-skillset (innates,
     skills, spells). Titles `Multiclass` and `Races` also get hardcoded
     sections. Editing those pages means authoring only the static part.

2. **`attrib_help()`** - appends per-command attributes (stat usage)
    loaded at boot from `docs/lib/information/command_attributes.txt`
    (`src/cmd/wikihelp.c`, boot loader). If the file is missing, only a debug log
    line notes it. Coverage is complete: every command name registered in
    `src/cmd/interp.c` has an entry, plus legacy entries keyed by ability names
    that are not commands (`apply poison`, `parry`, ...) which serve
    `help <ability>` lookups. Each entry lists the `GET_C_*` stats its
    handler (or skill-gated helper chain) actually uses; commands whose
    handlers consult no stats carry just the header line. The loader holds
    up to `CMD_ATTRIB_MAX` entries (1024, `src/cmd/wikihelp.h`) and bounds-checks
    the count, logging and skipping anything beyond the cap.

Without MySQL (`-D__NO_MYSQL__` builds), the same command loads and caches the
tracked source files that feed the database importer. It applies the importer's
precedence - individual `lib/information` pages, then `help_index`, then
`duris_help_parsed.hlp` - and provides case-insensitive exact and substring
searches without a database connection. Missing or structurally invalid source
catalogs fail closed with the normal help-system error instead of silently
returning the former disabled stub.

The same client-free content path serves the existing `mud_info` callers for
motd, news, wizmotd, credits, FAQ, rules, and wizlist directly from their
allow-listed `lib/information/` files. This keeps boot/login and information
commands functional without changing the database-backed lookup path.

## Content pipeline

```
lib/information/*          help/                      database
|- motd, news, faq    -+   |- duris_help.hlp          +-------------+
|- help, rules, ...   |-->|- duris_help_parsed.hlp ->| pages       |
+- hints.txt, help_index  +- (parsed inline by the    | mud_info    |
                             import script)           +-------------+
        scripts/import_help_to_prod.sh
```

`scripts/import_help_to_prod.sh`:

> [!WARNING]
> Despite its name, this script can write to any database selected by `.env`
> or to a remote host supplied with `--remote`. Run `--dry-run` first, verify
> `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, and `DB_NAME`, and take a database backup before a live
> import. `--clean` deletes all rows from `pages` before re-importing content.
> The script prompts for confirmation for live and clean operations.

- Maps files from `lib/information/` into `mud_info` (motd, news, wizmotd)
  and `pages` (help, help.1/2, guild/ship/kingdom helps, faq, rules, info,
  credits, wizlist, hints).
- `hints.txt` now lives at `docs/lib/information/hints.txt`; the script reads
  it from there (the login screen streams it via `src/account/nanny.c`).
- Imports the parsed help entries from `help/duris_help_parsed.hlp` (~500+
  topics); the help index is parsed inline by an embedded Python heredoc in
  the script (~1500 entries as of the immortal-command and full
  spell/skill coverage).
- **Import order matters**: Section 2 (`help_index`) runs before Section 3
  (`duris_help_parsed.hlp`). Both write with DELETE-by-title + INSERT, so a
  title present in both files ends up owned by `duris_help_parsed.hlp`.
  Titles compare case-insensitively (MySQL default collation). Check both
  sources before adding an entry to `help_index`.
- Title parsing in `help_index`: unquoted titles are truncated at `(` -
  `PURGE (Spell)` stores page title `PURGE`; quoted titles keep everything
  inside the quotes - `"ECHO (IMMORTAL)"` stores the full string. Use
  quoting whenever you need parentheses in a page title.
- motd/news/wizmotd are cached into memory at boot (`src/world/db.c`) and re-read
  only by the immortal `page` command (level 60+, `src/cmd/actcomm.c`). After
  importing new copies, run `page` or restart; otherwise players keep
  seeing the old text. Imported help pages reach players at the next automatic
  refresh, or at once with `page help`; credits, FAQ and wizlist with `page info`
  ([information-cache.md](../operations/information-cache.md)).
- Content is hex-encoded into `DELETE`+`INSERT` SQL so arbitrary text survives;
  supports `--dry-run`.
- `lib/information/help_index` carries one entry per immortal command
  (everything listed by `wizhelp`, levels 57-62), written against the
  command implementations in `src/`. Bare-command titles
  (`POOFIN (Immortal Command)` -> page `POOFIN`) are exact-match
  discoverable; names colliding with spells/skills are quoted so the
  parentheses survive (`"ECHO (IMMORTAL)"`). Because import deletes by
  title, new entries must never re-use an existing bare title.

## Editing help

- Authoring rules and formatting conventions:
  [`docs/content/HELP_STYLE_GUIDE.md`](HELP_STYLE_GUIDE.md). The style
  guide is spell-oriented (stat header block); immortal command entries in
  `help_index` instead use a `Syntax:` line, a rank/level line, a short
  description, and `See also:` - follow the existing entries there.
- In-game topic text lives in `pages`; the import script is the only write
  path (no in-game editor exists - nothing in `src/` inserts into or updates
  `pages`). Update the source files and re-run the import script; editing the
  database directly would silently diverge from the flat-file sources. See the
  warning above before importing to a shared or remote database.
- Command attribute changes go in
  `docs/lib/information/command_attributes.txt` and require a server restart
  (loaded once at boot).
