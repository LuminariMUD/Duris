# Configuration

Duris reads environment settings from `.env` in the data directory during
startup. The parser accepts one `KEY=VALUE` assignment per line; blank lines and
lines beginning with `#` are ignored. Values are not shell-expanded or
quote-aware, so do not wrap values in quotes. Existing process environment
variables are preserved because `.env` only supplies variables that are not
already set.

Start from [`.env.example`](../../.env.example):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
```

Keep `.env` local and never commit passwords, HMAC secrets, or production
connection details. The server checks metadata before reading: `.env` must be
a regular file owned by the effective server user and must grant no permission
beyond owner read/write (`0600`).

## Output profiles

`DURIS_OUTPUT_PROFILES_FILE` optionally names an absolute path to a versioned JSON
configuration of channel profiles, dictionaries, and foreground recipes. Startup
loads it once before gameplay; an absent setting uses Preserve, and an invalid
initial file logs a diagnostic and uses the same fallback. Explicit reload APIs
publish complete validated snapshots and retain the previous snapshot on failure.
Message rendering performs no configuration I/O. See the
[profile guide](../guides/OUTPUT_PROFILES.md) and
[versioned sample](../examples/output-profiles-v1.json) for the schema and bounds.

Loading a profile does not opt existing callers into styling. Callers still need
an explicit output context. Player preferences are in
[OUTPUT_PREFERENCES.md](../guides/OUTPUT_PREFERENCES.md) and animation in
[SCENERY_COLORIZATION.md](../guides/SCENERY_COLORIZATION.md).

## Telemetry runtime

Telemetry is opt-in at the server boundary. The parent startup path should pass
`telemetry_runtime_options_from_environment()` to `telemetry_runtime_init()`;
this source performs no database access, and reads only the reviewed property
catalog at bootstrap. `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` must be an accepted true value
(`TRUE`, `1`, `YES`, or `ON`) before any telemetry worker starts. Unset, false,
malformed, or out-of-range values fail closed to the default-disabled snapshot.
A client-free (`__NO_MYSQL__`) build always returns `flatfile_disabled` and
remains disabled, even when the opt-in variable is true.

| Variable | Default when opted in | Accepted values / range | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` | disabled | `TRUE`/`1`/`YES`/`ON`; false equivalents disable | Explicitly opt into the SQL telemetry writer. |
| `TELEMETRY_BACKEND` | `sql` on SQL builds | `sql`, `flatfile_disabled`, `disabled`, `off` | Select SQL or the deliberate disabled backend; flat-file is not an observational sink. |
| `TELEMETRY_PROPERTY_CATALOG_FILE` | required for enabled SQL | owner-readable reviewed catalog path | Full effective-property digest to stable property-version mapping; missing or invalid input disables telemetry only. |
| `TELEMETRY_CONFIG_REVISION` | `1` | positive `uint64` | Reviewed effective configuration revision floor. |
| `TELEMETRY_BUILD_VERSION`, `TELEMETRY_CONTENT_VERSION` | `1` | positive `uint32` | Versioned inputs included in the config identity. |
| `TELEMETRY_CLASSIFIER_VERSION`, `TELEMETRY_POLICY_VERSION` | `1` | positive `uint32` | Classifier/policy identities attached to observations. |
| `TELEMETRY_SEASON_ID`, `TELEMETRY_ENVIRONMENT_ID` | `1` | positive `uint64` | Scope identity carried by session records. |
| `TELEMETRY_INTERVAL_USEC` | proposal default | `1` through the proposal maximum | Activity interval cadence. |
| `TELEMETRY_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_USEC` | `300000000` | `1` through the proposal maximum | Cumulative session checkpoint cadence. |
| `TELEMETRY_ACTIVE_WINDOW_USEC` | proposal default | `1` through the proposal maximum | Recent-evidence active window. |
| `TELEMETRY_CONTEXT_SEGMENTS_PER_MINUTE` | proposal default | `1` through the configured cap | Context segment rate cap. |
| `TELEMETRY_PULSE_SLOT_COUNT` | `1` | `1` through the configured cap | Number of staggered pulse cohorts. |

The catalog is a reviewed, preloaded text file. Blank lines and lines beginning
with `#` are ignored; every other line must contain exactly four whitespace-
separated fields:

```text
<64 lowercase-or-uppercase hex digest> <property_version> <stable_namespace> <stable_catalog_version>
```

All three numeric fields are nonzero `uint32` values. Full digests must be
unique, and a `property_version` may not be reused for another full digest.
Unknown effective digests are refused; the runtime never derives a usable
property identity from a digest prefix, increments a process-local counter, or
uses `TELEMETRY_PROPERTY_VERSION`. The loader rejects malformed, duplicate, or
collision entries before the worker starts. After bootstrap, capture/reload,
pulse, and action paths perform no catalog file I/O or SQL query. The effective
reader calls the game's normal `get_property()` conversion with each registry
fallback, so a property reload is observed only after `apply_properties()` has
rebuilt its cached consumers.

These values are copied into one immutable snapshot and fingerprinted before
capture. Changing the environment requires the normal server restart/config
review path. Capture and pulse remain fixed-value, bounded operations: they do
not query SQL, append a spool, or call `fsync` on the game thread. The transport
worker owns its private repository connection; DB-down operation stays degraded
and does not borrow gameplay persistence or reject saves/copyover.

### Telemetry shutdown request and final reap

Shutdown has two lifecycle steps. `telemetry_runtime_shutdown()` closes
telemetry admission, marks the runtime `stopping`, asks the worker to stop, and
waits only until the supplied monotonic deadline for the worker to report done.
It does not detach the worker, reset runtime/config state, or call repository
teardown. `accepted` means the worker reported done within that request window;
the worker handle and borrowed callback binding remain owned until the reap.
If a repository callback is still running at the deadline, the request returns
`stopping` and retains all state so the callback can finish safely.

`telemetry_runtime_final_reap()` is mandatory for an enabled runtime after the
request, including when the request returned `stopping` or the runtime clock
could not provide a deadline. It joins the worker before invoking repository
and transport teardown, and may block on an in-flight repository callback.
Call it from the off-game-thread process-lifetime shutdown path, before
`shutdown_mysql()` or process return; it is not a hard bounded shutdown step.

Copyover version 15 stores one bounded telemetry handoff per preserved telnet
session. Save accounts through the handoff cut and writes only value data;
recover allocates a new process-local connection and resumes the logical session.
Legacy copyover versions and failed handoff capture use an explicit absent
handoff, so the next observation marks an unclosed tail instead of inventing
continuity. Telemetry resume failure is logged and never rejects the game-state
copyover. Before writing candidate handoffs, synchronous copyover requests a
worker-owned flush and waits at most 250ms. It writes absent handoffs unless
all admitted records are acknowledged without permanent rejection. This wait
never issues SQL or stops/joins the worker on the game thread; a failed copyover
can continue using the same runtime.

## Persistence

`PERSISTENCE_MODE` selects one whole-server authority. It defaults to
`mariadb-primary`. The accepted values are `mariadb-primary`,
`mariadb-primary-flatfile-fallback`, and `flatfile-primary`. A MariaDB client build accepts
`mariadb-primary`; a client-free flat build accepts `flatfile-primary`. The legacy mixed
fallback token is recognized for a clear diagnostic but fails closed because mixed
per-operation authority transfer is not supported.

| Variable | Requirement | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PERSISTENCE_MODE` | Optional; defaults to `mariadb-primary` | Select the complete persistence authority; mixed per-write failover is not supported. |
| `FLATFILE_STATE_DIR` | Required by `flatfile-primary` | Absolute server-user-owned directory with mode `0700` or stricter. |
| BACKUP_POLICY_FILE | Required for pre-cycle and scheduled backups | Absolute owner-only approved JSON policy; see [BACKUPS.md](BACKUPS.md). |
| `PREBOOT_BACKUP` | Optional; off unless `1` | Have `cycle_mud.sh` take a backup before every boot, and refuse the boot when it fails. Off by default: the backup timer takes the backups. |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Required: `local` or `production` | Runtime trust role. |
| `DB_HOST` | Required by `mariadb-primary` | MySQL/MariaDB host. |
| `DB_PORT` | Optional; `1`-`65535` | Database TCP port; the client default applies when omitted. |
| `DB_USER` | Required by `mariadb-primary` | Database account. Name it for its environment (`duris_local`, `duris_staging`, `duris_prod`), so that a command or credential sent to the wrong server fails to log in. |
| `DB_PASSWD` | Required by `mariadb-primary` | Database password. |
| `DB_NAME` | Required by `mariadb-primary` | Requested database name. |
| `DB_ALLOWED_TARGETS` | Required by `mariadb-primary` | Comma-separated exact `host/database` pairs; the resolved pair must match. |
| `DB_SOCKET` | Optional, local role only | Protected local Unix socket used instead of remote transport. |
| `DB_TLS` | Required as `TRUE` for non-loopback hosts | Enforce encrypted database transport. |
| `DB_SSL_CA` | Required for non-loopback hosts | Regular CA file used to verify the database server certificate. |
| `CRITICAL_COMMAND_JOURNAL_DIR` | Required outside mini mode | Absolute server-user-owned `0700` directory for the locker identification receipts. It is named for the critical-command journal it held before the persistence reset; nothing is journaled any more. |
| `MAINTENANCE_STATE_FILE` | Optional; `bin/server/maintenance-scheduler.state` | Durable scheduler cursor/completion state; parent directory must be server-user controlled. |
| `COPYOVER_STATE_FILE` | Optional; `copyover.dat` | State file a copyover writes and the new image reads; its `.tmp` sibling is in the same directory, which the server user must be able to write. Docker sets `/var/lib/duris/copyover.dat`. |

`scripts/cycle_mud.sh --check-config` validates the selected mode without starting the
server. Add `--production` to require `ENVIRONMENT=production` and the production-port
runtime role; the production systemd unit always supplies that flag. `--production`
cannot be combined with `--dev` or `--minimal`. In `flatfile-primary`, the launcher
does not require database settings, run migrations or schema checks, invoke MySQL
shutdown logging, or select a database backup because Redis happens to be enabled. It
snapshots the selected `FLATFILE_STATE_DIR` before boot and refuses to start if that
snapshot fails. Build the client-free binary with
`make -C src PERSISTENCE_BACKEND=flatfile` for this mode.

Flat-file IP connection history is stored in the owner-only metadata authority so the
existing one-hour racewar-side rule and staff/player information paths remain functional
without a database. Treat the state root and its backups as private player data. Boot
closes sessions left active by an interrupted prior run and refuses corrupt IP history.

`DB_NAME` selects the requested database and `DB_ALLOWED_TARGETS` authorizes the
resolved target. The listen port is an additional guard, not the primary selector.
Production role requires the production port, `7777` unless `DURIS_PRODUCTION_PORT`
selects another; on any other port an explicitly production-like name (`duris` or
`duris_prod`) is redirected to `duris_dev` before the allow-list check. Use a separate
database account, target, and non-production port for development. The
redirect does not make a production credential safe to reuse locally.

The database server's memory is its own setting, not one of these variables. MariaDB's
default buffer pool (`innodb_buffer_pool_size`) is 128 MB, smaller than the game's data.
The repository's default is 1 GB: `compose.yaml` starts MariaDB with
`--innodb-buffer-pool-size=1G`, and a server's own MariaDB sets
`innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G` in its configuration unless its host calls for another size.

Every connection has 10-second connect/read/write deadlines and disables automatic
reconnect. MySQL's client default keeps reconnect off without invoking its deprecated
`MYSQL_OPT_RECONNECT` option; MariaDB builds set the still-supported option to false
explicitly. Every connection must establish the same verified session contract:
`utf8mb4`, time zone `+00:00`, `READ-COMMITTED`, and `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`,
`ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`, and `NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION`. Loopback TCP and an
explicit local-role socket are treated as protected local transport. Any other host
requires enforced TLS, CA verification, and a negotiated cipher. Boot also requires a
supported MySQL 8.0 or MariaDB 10.11 normalized metadata fingerprint before mutation.

The main connection holds the lock that keeps a second server off the database
(`duris.runtime.<database>`). The game thread issues no query on it after boot, so it
sets its session `wait_timeout` to 31536000 seconds, the most the server takes, and is
never closed for idling. The pool's connections keep the server's `wait_timeout`: a
borrower that finds its connection closed gets a new one. If the lock itself is lost,
because the database restarted or ended the session, nothing more is written: the status
log says so once, and `/health` reports persistence unavailable until the game restarts.

The receipt directory is mandatory for normal operation. It must be absolute, owned by
the server user, and mode `0700` or stricter; receipts are permission checked,
checksummed and size bounded. Do not place it under a shared or automatically cleaned
temporary path.

## Redis

Redis is optional. It is disabled unless `REDIS=TRUE` (case-insensitive).
When enabled, it stores floor-drop recovery data, object UID state, caches, and
optional immutable world-recovery generations. Player dirty state remains local to the
player-save pipeline.

| Variable | Default | Accepted values / range | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `REDIS` | disabled | `TRUE` enables it | Enable Redis integration. |
| `REDIS_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | hostname or IP | Redis TCP host. Must be empty when `REDIS_SOCKET` is set. |
| `REDIS_PORT` | `6379` | `1`-`65535` | Redis TCP port. Must be empty when `REDIS_SOCKET` is set; an explicitly invalid TCP value disables Redis at boot. |
| `REDIS_SOCKET` | empty | Absolute path, at most 107 bytes | Optional local Unix socket used instead of TCP. It is mutually exclusive with `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT` and with TLS. Every runtime worker uses the same socket through the shared adapter. |
| `REDIS_DB` | `0` | `0`-`255` | Database explicitly selected by every runtime connection and destructive maintenance command. |
| `REDIS_NAMESPACE` | none | `duris:<ENVIRONMENT>:<deployment>` | Required isolation prefix for every active key and channel. Deployment is 1-32 lowercase letters, digits, hyphens, or underscores and must not begin or end with punctuation. |
| `REDIS_USERNAME` | empty | Redis ACL username | Shared local-development fallback. Production does not accept it in place of scoped identities. |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | empty | Redis ACL password | Password paired with the local-development fallback identity. |
| `REDIS_WORLD_USERNAME`, `REDIS_WORLD_PASSWORD` | local fallback | Complete ACL pair | World/floor recovery identity. Required in production. |
| `REDIS_PRESENCE_USERNAME`, `REDIS_PRESENCE_PASSWORD` | local fallback | Complete ACL pair | Presence key and event-channel identity. Required in production. |
| `REDIS_CACHE_USERNAME`, `REDIS_CACHE_PASSWORD` | local fallback | Complete ACL pair | Reconstructible content-cache identity. Required in production. |
| `REDIS_DONATION_USERNAME`, `REDIS_DONATION_PASSWORD` | local fallback | Complete ACL pair | Donation subscription identity. Required in production only when the subscriber is enabled. |
| `REDIS_MAINTENANCE_USERNAME`, `REDIS_MAINTENANCE_PASSWORD` | local fallback | Complete ACL pair | Retired ship cleanup, pwipe, and stopped-server destructive-maintenance identity. Required in production. The shell helper passes its password through `REDISCLI_AUTH`, not a command argument. |
| `REDIS_TLS` | `FALSE` | Exact `TRUE` or `FALSE` | Enables verified TLS for every TCP runtime and maintenance connection. Non-loopback production runtime endpoints require `TRUE`; destructive maintenance requires it for every non-loopback TCP target. Unix sockets require `FALSE`. |
| `REDIS_CA_CERT` | empty | Readable CA bundle | Required when Redis TLS is enabled and used for peer verification. |
| `REDIS_TLS_SERVER_NAME` | `REDIS_HOST` | Certificate DNS name | Optional runtime SNI and certificate-name override, useful when connecting by IP to a certificate issued for a DNS name. |
| `REDIS_ALLOWED_TARGETS` | none | Comma-separated exact `host:port/database` or `unix:/absolute/socket/database` values | Required destructive-maintenance allow-list. |
| `REDIS_WORLD_STATE` | disabled | `TRUE` enables it | Enable bounded capture and background publication of crash-recovery world generations. Off, the server does none of that work. See [what world recovery buys and costs](#what-world-recovery-buys-and-costs). |
| `REDIS_WORLD_STATE_INTERVAL` | `600` seconds | `5`-`3600` | Seconds from one capture's start to the next when world-state recovery is enabled. |
| `REDIS_WORLD_STATE_MAX_AGE` | the interval plus `600` seconds | the interval plus `600`, to `86400` | Maximum snapshot age accepted during recovery. A lower setting is raised to the minimum: it could only refuse every generation. |
| `REDIS_WORLD_STATE_SECRET` | none | `32`-`256` bytes | Independent HMAC key required when world recovery is enabled. It authenticates the manifest and complete generation payload; do not reuse Redis, database, donation, or DurisWeb credentials. |
| `REDIS_WORLD_STATE_SECRET_PREVIOUS` | empty | `32`-`256` bytes | Optional previous recovery HMAC key accepted only for reading and cleanup during a bounded rotation window. New generations are always signed by the current key. |
| `REDIS_DONATION_SUBSCRIBER` | disabled | Exact `TRUE` enables it | Subscribe to authenticated external donation notices. No polling job or subscriber connection exists by default. |
| `REDIS_DONATION_SECRET` | none | At least 32 bytes | Independent HMAC key required when the donation subscriber is enabled. Do not reuse a Redis, database, or DurisWeb secret. |

### What world recovery buys and costs

World recovery is a convenience, not a safety net, and it is off unless a server sets
`REDIS_WORLD_STATE=TRUE`. Characters, pets, corpses, lockers, banks and shops are saved
without it. It brings the mobs, the objects on the ground, the doors and the zone ages back
as the last capture had them after a crash or a cold restart, where the boot would otherwise
reset every zone. A copyover keeps the world by itself.

Two kinds of object on the ground are not brought back:

- An item a character logged in with, or was granted, and then dropped. The ownership
  ledger in memory names the character for it, a drop does not change that, and a capture
  and the floor journal leave out a tree whose custody is not its room's. It is lost at a
  crash or a cold restart, as it is with recovery off. An item picked up during the
  session, from the ground or a corpse, has no such entry and is captured where it lies,
  also after a save.
- An item a character's save holds by the time of the restore. It was taken after the
  capture, so its holder has it.

What it costs, measured on the full world (54,000 mobs, 253,000 rooms):

- **The game thread.** While a capture runs, the game thread gives it at most 2 ms every
  second pulse (half a second). A capture is about 40 such calls, 20 seconds, with nobody
  playing or with 30 players.
- **Redis.** Each generation is the whole world: about 45 MiB after a boot and 3.3 KiB more
  for every object on the ground, 69 MiB with 15,000. Redis holds two generations while one
  replaces the other, and uses about a third more memory than their bytes.
- **A restart.** A boot that restores a generation takes 3 seconds, less than one that
  resets every zone.

`REDIS_WORLD_STATE_INTERVAL` sets how often that is paid: ten minutes by default. A shorter
interval costs more of both; a longer one restores an older world. One limit follows the
interval, so that a generation taken at it is still accepted at boot: when the next capture
replaces it, a generation is as old as the interval plus the time that capture took, and the
server then has to restart. `REDIS_WORLD_STATE_MAX_AGE`, past which boot refuses a
generation, is at least the interval plus 600 seconds (300 for a capture's budget, 300 for
the restart).

World recovery is intentionally separate from player saves and reconstructible caches.
At boot the server constructs immutable connection settings for each subsystem. In
production, every required scoped username must be nonempty and distinct; an incomplete
pair or reused username disables Redis before gameplay starts. Authentication occurs only
when a worker, boot/recovery path, or maintenance path opens or reconnects a connection.
Gameplay enqueue and cache-read paths do not perform authentication or connection work.

Provision ACL users with unique passwords and the narrowest command set supported by the
deployed Redis version. Key/channel boundaries should be:

| Identity | Allowed keys/channels |
| --- | --- |
| world | `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:*:world_state:*` and `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:*:floor_*` |
| presence | `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:*:presence:*`, `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:*:presence_op:*`, `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:*:player`, and `mud:online` as keys; publish only to `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:*:player` |
| cache | `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:*:cache:*` |
| donation | subscribe only to `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:*:nchat`; no key access |
| maintenance | `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:*`, `mud:*`, and `ship:snapshot:*`; allow only connection, scan, delete, and required Lua execution commands |

The world, presence, and cache workers need their respective read/write/Lua commands plus
`PING` and `SELECT`; they do not need administrative, server-management, or cross-prefix
access. The donation identity needs only `PING`, `SELECT`, and `SUBSCRIBE` with the channel
pattern above. The presence script names its event channel and the retired `mud:online` key
among its keys, so the presence identity needs both as key patterns too: without them Redis
refuses every presence update. Maintenance is deliberately broader in key scope because it
removes active and retired Duris surfaces, but it must not have access to other
applications' prefixes.
Test the exact ACL rules on a disposable Redis instance before deployment; Redis command
categories and Lua ACL behavior can differ across supported server versions.

At boot, one publisher claims a writer lease of 60 seconds, which the game loop renews
every 20. Each background
publication verifies that lease and expected prior pointer, writes the immutable
sequence-keyed payload, advances the current pointer and diagnostic metadata, consumes
the pre-capture floor hash, and renews the lease in one atomic Lua compare-and-set. A
stale or second writer cannot publish. A renewal and a publication take the lease when
nobody holds it, so a writer whose lease ran out while the game loop stood still, or was
lost with a Redis restart, holds it again by itself. The single script also reduces
background Redis round trips compared with a watched transaction.

A crashed writer's lease runs out within a minute of the crash. The boot after it restores
the generation and consumes it whoever holds the lease, so that no generation is restored
twice; it claims the lease once it is free, and a capture attempt that could not start is
made again 30 seconds later, not an interval later. Its first generation is published
about a minute and a half after the boot, and a second crash before that has nothing to
restore: the boot resets every zone. A copyover gives the lease up before its exec, and the
image it starts claims it at boot.
All of those keys use `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:<epoch>:` with the active SQL season epoch captured at
boot. An old process can therefore write only its abandoned epoch after a reset; it cannot
create a snapshot visible to the new season.
Boot accepts only a complete, non-expired generation whose schema, sequence, size, and
checksum validate. It combines the generation with versioned binary floor records,
validates the full semantic graph, and batch-reconciles every custody-bearing item UID
against SQL before creating any entity. Authenticated reconstructible world-pop objects
are restored without inventing SQL custody, while SQL-restored player corpses are excluded.
A world-pop object that an owner holds by then is left out, with the tree it was captured
in: a character took it after the capture and saved, so the character has it.
A failed or stale generation is retained for diagnosis and the
server performs a full normal zone boot.

World generations are capped at 256 MiB; the full world is 45 to 70 MiB. Redis holds one
generation, and two while the next one replaces it, so allow it twice the generation's size.
Restore checks the value length inside Redis before transfer. Each published generation receives a TTL of at least one hour or four
times `REDIS_WORLD_STATE_MAX_AGE`, whichever is greater, so abandoned generations expire.
The background publisher scales its write timeout for the blob size, up to five seconds;
this does not extend the game-loop Redis command deadline.

A graceful shutdown takes one last capture once the players are saved and gone, so a clean
restart restores the world as the shutdown left it and not as the last periodic capture had
it. After
all world and floor work drains, the fenced writer records a one-use clean-shutdown marker
for that exact sequence. The next boot consumes the marker and reports `clean restart`
only when the validated current generation matches; otherwise it reports `crash`
recovery. Successful restore consumes that generation without disabling future snapshots.

Floor deltas use a separate background worker bounded to eight batches and 16 MiB. Each
batch holds at most 2,048 mutations, each value is capped at 2 MiB, and keys are capped
at 128 bytes. Each value is a binary tree of at most 512 identity-preserving items; larger
trees fail capture closed rather than being truncated. Before world capture, an ordered
worker barrier confirms all earlier deltas and pauses later publication; the generation
handoff deletes the acknowledged hash atomically, then post-barrier deltas resume.
Gameplay performs bounded fixed-memory serialization but no Redis socket, SQL, disk,
process, or logging I/O for floor drops, pickups, or snapshot preflight.

World capture is an explicitly fuzzy crash-recovery snapshot with a hard five-minute
capture deadline. The game thread gives it at most 2 ms every second pulse, and a capture of
the full world takes about 20 seconds; an expired capture is discarded and retried later
rather than published. NPC inventory/equipment and
carried gold are excluded from recovery. Before any recovery entity is created, every
floor-item UID is looked up in SQL: an item captured with the room's custody must still
have it, or nothing is restored, and an item captured without custody that an owner holds
by then is left out with its tree. An owner holds an item when an ownership record names
it, except a character whose save no longer has the item: that character dropped it.
`REDIS_WORLD_STATE_MAX_AGE`
still controls how old a completed durable generation may be when boot attempts restore.

When three attempts in a row leave no generation, the server raises one persistence alert,
`domain=world_recovery`. Its action is the reason: `capture_failed`, `capture_expired`,
`publish_failed`, `writer_unavailable` (the lease is held elsewhere or Redis was down at
boot) or `floor_unavailable` (the floor worker cannot write). Its detail is
`failures=3 last_ack_sequence=N last_ack_age_secs=N`, the last published generation and
the age boot would judge it by, `-1` when this boot has published none. The next published generation ends the
run, and a later run raises its own alert. `world persistence` and `redis detailed` show
the same age as `last_ack_age_s`.

The in-game `redis` and `redis detailed` commands read bounded local worker/pipeline
telemetry only; they never query Redis. Shared boot, recovery, and stopped-server
maintenance commands are grouped by redacted subsystem and operation kind, with local
call, failure, latency, last-success-age, and reconnect counters. Presence, report-cache,
floor, donation, and world-publication workers expose the same operation health dimensions
alongside their bounded queue state. No key, value, account, player, item, endpoint, or
credential is retained. Online artifact, fraglist, epic-zone, and named cache clears remove
the local entry and submit a background invalidation, reporting whether that submission
was accepted. The in-game `redis clear world`, `redis
clear floor`, and `redis clear all` commands are refused while the server is running
because their scans, writer fencing, and exact postflight cannot safely run on the
simulation thread. Stop the server and use the maintenance clear workflow for broad state
removal.

For a local development session, the following is a reasonable starting point:

```text
REDIS=TRUE
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_SOCKET=
REDIS_DB=0
REDIS_NAMESPACE=duris:local:default
REDIS_TLS=FALSE
REDIS_ALLOWED_TARGETS=127.0.0.1:6379/0
REDIS_WORLD_STATE=FALSE
REDIS_WORLD_STATE_SECRET=local-development-only-world-state-hmac-change-before-shared-use
REDIS_DONATION_SUBSCRIBER=TRUE
REDIS_DONATION_SECRET=local-development-only-donation-hmac-change-before-shared-use
```

Those fixed secrets are local-only placeholders; the world-recovery one is there for when
the switch is turned on. Replace both with distinct random secrets before connecting any
shared or externally reachable service.

Stop the server before clearing Redis state. `scripts/clear-redis.sh --confirm
<host:port/database|unix:/absolute/socket/database>` loads the owner-only `.env`, requires
`ENVIRONMENT=local`, checks the
exact target against `REDIS_ALLOWED_TARGETS`, applies the configured database, ACL, and TLS
settings, uses the maintenance identity when configured, and deletes only
`<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:*`, legacy `mud:*`, and retired
`ship:snapshot:*` keys. It uses cursor scans and at most 128 keys per `DEL`, verifies that
all three Duris patterns are empty afterward, and leaves
unrelated application keys intact. Missing `redis-cli`, connection failure, unexpected replies, wrong
confirmation, or a failed postflight returns nonzero.

Redis uses a 250 ms connect timeout and 100 ms command timeout. A cache failure may
degrade a report, while a world-generation failure preserves the prior generation and
floor deltas. Neither case authorizes a synchronous player save.

Presence login/logout updates use a dedicated worker with a fixed 1,024-job queue, bounded
timeouts, and exponential reconnect backoff. Gameplay paths only encode the bounded JSON
payload and enqueue it; they never wait for a presence connection or Redis command. Each
state change and optional `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:<epoch>:player` event is one idempotent Lua operation. Pwipe joins
and cancels this worker before checked deletion, and shutdown gives it a one-second drain
deadline. Connection outages retain ordered jobs until Redis returns; a job is dropped
after three command-level failures so a permanent schema or ACL error cannot block the
queue indefinitely. Online state uses `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:<epoch>:presence:current` plus
`<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:<epoch>:presence:session:<instance>:<pid>` keys with a 180-second TTL. The worker refreshes
active leases every 60 seconds in batches of at most 64; a crashed server, failed logout,
or superseded worker therefore cannot leave persistent presence data. A due heartbeat is
processed ahead of queued login/logout work so a sustained backlog cannot starve active
leases past their TTL.

Named, fraglist, epic-zone, and artifact report reads use a bounded 32-entry in-process
cache and never wait for Redis during gameplay. Redis publication and invalidation use a
separate worker bounded to 64 jobs and 4 MiB of queued values; repeated mutations for one
key are coalesced. Values are limited to 1 MiB and keys to 128 bytes. Existing artifact
cache values under `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:<epoch>:cache:*` are seeded with their remaining TTL in one boot-only Redis operation, while
expired or persistent legacy artifact values are ignored. Pwipe cancels the worker before
checked deletion and shutdown gives it a one-second drain deadline.

Retired `ship:snapshot:*` invalidations use a separate bounded asynchronous worker with
the maintenance identity. Ship deletion and owner-rename paths only enqueue the legacy
key; connection, authentication, and deletion stay off the gameplay thread. Pwipe cancels
the worker before its checked maintenance sweep, and normal shutdown gives it a one-second
drain deadline.

Every report cache has a bounded freshness contract: named-set output expires after 24
hours, while fraglist, epic-zone, and artifact output expire after 15 minutes. Successful
combat-outcome and level-cap commits also invalidate the fraglist asynchronously. The
fraglist stores only stable leaderboard/cap content plus an absolute cap deadline in the
versioned `FRC1` frame. Each local hit renders the countdown from that deadline, so the
timer advances without a Redis or SQL query. Frame schema, generated time, content
revision, component lengths, maximum age, and clock skew are validated before display.

Donation notices use a separately gated, authenticated subscriber worker. Connect,
subscribe, socket reads, validation, replay filtering, and reconnect backoff all run off
the simulation thread. It subscribes only to `<REDIS_NAMESPACE>:season:<epoch>:nchat`, where the epoch is
captured from SQL once at boot. Its delivery queue holds at most 64 fixed-size validated events;
each game pulse dequeues at most eight and performs no Redis work. Invalid, stale,
oversized, replayed, or excess envelopes are counted and ignored. The publisher contract
and signature format are in [the donation event reference](../reference/api/donation-events.md).

## Character creation and gameplay modes

The unrestricted creation switches are intended for local testing and should
remain disabled on a live server:

| Variable | Enabled when | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CREATION_ALL_RACES` | value equals `TRUE` | Adds normally unavailable races to character creation. They are selected by typing the race name. |
| `CREATION_ALL_CLASSES` | value equals `TRUE` | Adds every defined class to character creation, including restricted classes. |

The character-creation settings affect the menus and validation paths; they do
not change the underlying race/class data or make restricted choices suitable
for production.

Above the account-name prompt, the login screen shows one blinking line naming
each enabled mode: `STAGING`, `CHAOS`, `ALL-RACES` and `ALL-CLASSES`. It shows
nothing when none is enabled. `DURIS_STAGING` exists only for this banner; set it
to `TRUE` (case-insensitive) on a public staging server.

Chaos is a separate, deliberately selected server-wide ruleset. Its values are
read at process start and are case-sensitive:

| Variable | Default | Accepted values / effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CHAOS_MUD` | disabled | Exact `TRUE` enables Chaos rules, including rebuilding characters at mortal level 56. Unset or `FALSE` disables the mode; any other value warns and disables it. |
| `CHAOS_EQ_PROFILE` | `standard` | `standard` selects the high-end starter equipment profile; `enhanceable` selects only equipment and class fundamentals admitted by the enhancement index. An invalid value warns and uses `standard`. |
| `CHAOS_STARTER_BONUSES` | `TRUE` when Chaos is enabled | Master switch for all optional new-character starter bonuses. Exact `FALSE` disables them; an invalid value warns and fails closed. |
| `CHAOS_STARTER_FRIGATE` | `TRUE` | Grants the existing dock reward as a free-frigate claim. Requires Chaos and the master starter switch. |
| `CHAOS_STARTER_EPIC_SKILLS` | `TRUE` | Grants eligible no-specialization epic skills to a new Chaos character. Requires Chaos and the master starter switch. |
| `CHAOS_STARTER_EPIC_POINTS` | `TRUE` | Grants 20,000 epic points through the critical epic ledger. Requires Chaos and the master starter switch. |
| `CHAOS_STARTER_BANK_PLATINUM` | `TRUE` | Grants 1,000,000 bank platinum through the critical currency ledger. Requires Chaos and the master starter switch. |
| `CHAOS_STARTER_MATERIALS` | `TRUE` | Adds the persistent Chaos craft pouch to the new-character equipment bag and enables its material-source behavior. Requires Chaos and the master starter switch. |
| `CHAOS_TEST_COMMANDS` | disabled | Exact `TRUE` exposes bounded integration-test helpers, but only when `ENVIRONMENT=local`. It does not enable Chaos mode. |

Every starter feature switch accepts only exact `TRUE` or `FALSE`; an invalid
feature value disables that feature. The complete equipment, durability, and
craft-pouch contract is in [CHAOS_MODE.md](../reference/CHAOS_MODE.md).

## WebSocket and proxy settings

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `LISTEN_ADDRESS` | Numeric IPv4 or IPv6 address applied to telnet, TLS telnet, and WebSocket listeners. Use `127.0.0.1` or `::1` for local development. |
| `DURIS_DEV_PORT` | Plain-telnet port selected by `--dev` and `--minimal`. It defaults to `4000`; values must be decimal ports from 1 through 65535 and must not be the production port. |
| `DURIS_PRODUCTION_PORT` | Optional plain-telnet port for the production role (`--production`). It defaults to `7777`; set it only when a second production-role install shares a host. Values must be decimal ports from 1 through 65535. |
| `DURIS_TLS_PORT` | Optional independent TLS telnet port. It defaults to `7778`, or to the plain-telnet port plus one when a custom plain port is supplied. Values must be decimal ports from 1 through 65535 and must differ from the plain port. |
| `DURIS_WEBSOCKET` | `TRUE` opens the WebSocket and HTTP health listener. It is off by default: a server is assumed to have no website, and a MUD-only server opens no such port and has no `GET /health`. The Docker deployment sets it, because the container's health check reads `/health`. |
| `DURIS_WEBSOCKET_PORT` | WebSocket and HTTP health-listener port. It defaults to `4050`; values must be decimal ports from 1 through 65535. |
| `DURIS_WEBSOCKET_LISTEN_ADDRESS` | WebSocket-only numeric listener address; defaults to `LISTEN_ADDRESS`, and to `127.0.0.1` when neither is set. Production requires exact loopback so a local TLS reverse proxy owns the public endpoint. |
| `DURIS_WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Exact comma-separated browser `Origin` allow-list. Required in production; non-browser service connections may omit `Origin`. |
| `DURISWEB_SECRET` | Current shared key for one-time DurisWeb challenge-response authentication. Production requires at least 32 characters and rejects the public example placeholder. See the DurisWeb API reference. |
| `DURISWEB_SECRET_PREVIOUS` | Optional previous service key accepted during a bounded zero-downtime rotation. In production it must be empty or at least 32 characters and non-placeholder; remove it after every backend has switched. |
| `DURISWEB_PRIVATE_PRESENCE` | Exact `TRUE` opts the authenticated backend into account names, IP addresses, client metadata, and invisible staff presence. The default WebSocket and Redis presence feeds omit them. |

### DurisWeb hook toggles

`lib/duris.properties` carries one key per MUD-gated DurisWeb hook. Values are
floats; `>= 0.5` is enabled, and a missing key defaults to enabled. Change them
at runtime with `properties set <key> <value>`; no restart is required, and the
MUD pushes the new state to connected DurisWeb peers. That in-game command is
in-memory until `properties save`. The authenticated
`durisweb_hook_set` service command used by the website console persists its
exact-whitelisted property atomically before acknowledging it.

| Property | Gates |
|----------|-------|
| `durisweb.hook.auction_new` | New auction broadcasts |
| `durisweb.hook.auction_bid` | Auction bid broadcasts |
| `durisweb.hook.auction_close` | Auction close broadcasts |
| `durisweb.hook.player_presence` | Player login and logout broadcasts (both) |
| `durisweb.hook.mud_shutdown` | Shutdown and crash notifications |
| `durisweb.hook.wholist` | Wholist responses to `request_wholist` |
| `durisweb.hook.admin_delete_character` | Administrative character deletion |
| `durisweb.hook.donation_delivery` | Applying donation events from Redis |

Ids are shared with the DurisWeb repository and defined at
`backend/src/hooks/registry.ts`. `connection_log` has no MUD property: it gates
DurisWeb's ingestion, not the MUD's `LOG_COMM` operational logging. The other
website-only ids (`flag_parsing`, `guild_parsing`, `zone_builder_parsing`, and
`process_control`) likewise have no MUD property; `terminal` is always-on and
controlled only by its permission and live-session checks.
| `DURIS_TRUSTED_PROXY_IP` | One immediate proxy IP address whose `X-Forwarded-For` header may be trusted for WebSocket and telnet connections. If unset, forwarded addresses are ignored. This is an address allow-list, not a CIDR range. |

With `DURIS_WEBSOCKET=TRUE`, WebSocket and `GET /health` listen on `DURIS_WEBSOCKET_PORT`
(default `4050`).
In production, the WebSocket listener must use loopback, the trusted proxy and
allowed origins must be configured, and the local reverse proxy must terminate
TLS before forwarding to this plaintext listener. The server refuses to create
the production listener when those controls are absent.
The health response reports only process and selected-persistence readiness.
MariaDB mode reads in-memory pool state, and flat-file mode reports ready only
after its private authority passes startup validation; neither path performs a
blocking backing-store query. Plain telnet defaults to `7777` and TLS telnet to
`7778`; a custom plain-telnet port uses the following port for TLS unless
`DURIS_TLS_PORT` provides an independent port. Configure a real `duris.crt` and
`duris.key` in the repository root for networked TLS. The operator key must be
owner-controlled and mode `0600` or stricter. The tracked self-signed key was removed;
run `./scripts/generate_localhost_cert.sh` to create an ignored machine-local fallback.
That fallback is accepted only with the explicit local role and an exact loopback
listener, and its key must also be owner-controlled and mode `0600` or stricter.

The WebSocket command table also carries the two account-recovery commands. `request_reset`
answers an `error` (not available) while the mail feature below is disabled; `complete_reset`
does not consult the switch and, since no code can exist then, answers `Invalid or expired
reset code` like any other code failure. `request_reset` takes `{"account": "<name>"}` and
answers `{"type": "account", "action": "reset_requested"}` for every name that passes the
length check, whether or not the account exists or a mail was queued (an unknown name is
charged against the address window exactly like an account without an email address); the
only other answers are an `error` for a rate-limited address (wait 10 minutes), the shared
register-bucket `error` (too many requests), an `error` when the feature is disabled, and an
`auth` failure for a service connection. `complete_reset` takes `{"account": "<name>", "code": "<32 hex digits;
dashes, spaces, and letter case are ignored>", "newPassword": "<at least 6 characters>"}`
and answers `{"type": "account", "action": "reset_completed"}` on success, after which the
client issues an ordinary `login`; every code-related failure is the single `error` text
`Invalid or expired reset code`, a missing field is `Missing reset fields`, and a short
password is reported before the code is examined. Both commands sit behind the existing
register and login rate buckets. Echo control has no meaning on this transport: hiding the
password field, and rendering the "a code may have been sent; one per account per 10
minutes" meaning of the telnet text, is the client's job.

## Account recovery mail

A player who has an email address on file can reset a forgotten account password by
typing `?` at the telnet password prompt, or through the WebSocket `request_reset` and
`complete_reset` commands above. The server mails a one-time code through libcurl SMTP
from one bounded worker thread. The feature is off unless `MAIL_ENABLED=TRUE`; while it is
off the password prompt is unchanged and `?` answers one not-available line.

| Variable | Requirement | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAIL_ENABLED` | Optional; `TRUE` or `FALSE` (case-insensitive), default `FALSE` | Enable switch. Unset, empty, or `FALSE` disables password reset by email; any other value is rejected. |
| `MAIL_HOST` | Required when `MAIL_ENABLED=TRUE` | SMTP relay host name or address, 1-253 bytes, accepted by libcurl's URL parser as a bare host (no `/`, `@`, `?`, `#`, or whitespace). Loopback means `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`. |
| `MAIL_PORT` | Optional; `1`-`65535`, default `587` | SMTP TCP port. `465` selects implicit TLS (`smtps://`); every other port uses `smtp://` with STARTTLS when `MAIL_TLS` is `TRUE`. |
| `MAIL_TLS` | Optional; `TRUE` or `FALSE` (case-insensitive), default `TRUE` | `TRUE` requires TLS for the whole session (a relay that refuses STARTTLS fails the send; there is no opportunistic mode). `FALSE` is accepted only for a loopback `MAIL_HOST` with no credentials. |
| `MAIL_USERNAME` | Optional; 1-255 bytes | SMTP AUTH user. Must be set together with `MAIL_PASSWORD`, and credentials require `MAIL_TLS=TRUE`. |
| `MAIL_PASSWORD` | Optional; 1-255 bytes | SMTP AUTH password. Read once at boot into the worker's private snapshot; never logged; no compiled default exists and the source contracts forbid one. |
| `MAIL_FROM` | Required when `MAIL_ENABLED=TRUE` | Envelope sender and `From:` header. A plain address that passes both the structural mail check and the account-layer email validation; the text after `@` forms the `Message-ID` domain. |

Validation is fail-closed by category: a rejected or incomplete setting disables the
feature for the whole run, the server boots normally, and `logs/log/status` names the
offending key, never its value. Certificate verification uses the system CA bundle and
cannot be disabled; there is no CA override and no verification switch.

Shell safety: `.env` values are bash-sourced by `scripts/cycle_mud.sh` (`set -a; source
.env`) and read unquoted by the server's own loader in `src/core/env_file.c` (255-byte
lines, no quoting or escaping, `setenv(name, value, 0)` so a variable already present in
the environment wins). Use only shell-safe characters in every `MAIL_*` value -- no
spaces, quotes, `$`, backticks, `;`, `#`, or `!`. A relay application password is the
intended shape; the server cannot detect a value that Bash has already reinterpreted.

The controls are compile-time constants in `src/account/account_recovery.h` and are
deliberately not environment-tunable: a code lives 15 minutes (`ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_TTL_SEC`),
at most one code is mailed per account every 10 minutes (`ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_COOLDOWN_SEC`),
a code dies after 5 wrong guesses (`ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_MAX_TOKEN_ATTEMPTS`), a telnet connection is dropped after 5 code attempts
(`ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_MAX_DESCRIPTOR_ATTEMPTS`; a WebSocket connection is instead refused with the
uniform code error until it reconnects), and one client address may
request 5 codes per 10 minutes (`ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_HOST_MAX_REQUESTS` over
`ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_HOST_WINDOW_SEC`; IPv6 clients are keyed by their /64 prefix). The mail
queue holds 256 messages and each send is bounded to 10 s connect / 20 s total with no
retry. The per-address window is keyed by the connection's peer address as the server sees
it: behind a TCP proxy that does not supply the PROXY protocol, every telnet player shares
one 5-per-10-minute budget, so such a deployment must raise
`ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_HOST_MAX_REQUESTS` (a reviewed source change) or accept the shared limit.
Whether production telnet is proxied is therefore something the operator must know.

Copyover and restart contract: codes, cooldowns, and queued mail live only in process
memory. A copyover or restart discards them, the player-facing text says so, and the
player simply requests a new code. Nothing is persisted, so there is no table, file, or
Redis key to migrate or clean. Operational log lines and the shutdown timing tail are
described in [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md#logs) and
[RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md#restart-and-crash-recovery).

## Diagnostics

Diagnostic switches are opt-in and are read once when the relevant subsystem
initializes. They can be noisy, so enable them only while investigating a
specific issue and restart the server after changing them.

| Variable | Value | Output / scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SQL_TRACE` | any non-empty value except `0`, `false`, or `off` | Metadata-only SQL execution events in the normal logs. |
| `GET_TRACE` | any non-empty value except `0`, `false`, or `off` | Debug logging for object pickup paths. |
| `DURIS_ZONE_RESET_TRACE` | positive integer | Zone-reset tracing. |
| `DURIS_CORPSE_TRACE` | any non-empty value except `0` | Corpse decay tracing. |
| `DURIS_PERSISTENCE_TRACE` | any non-empty value except `0` | Routine locker save, boot shopkeeper-restore and shopkeeper-save lines in `logs/log/debug`. Their failure lines are always written. |
| `DURIS_ACCEPT_DEBUG` | variable present, including an empty value | Connection-accept debug counters. |

`SQL_TRACE` never writes query text, bound values, MySQL error prose, account or
player values, or per-query files. Each event contains only a process-local
operation ID, compile-time source site, execution context, statement kind,
duration, numeric error code, and SQLSTATE. The operation ID is useful for log
correlation within one server process; it is not a durable transaction or
idempotency ID. Trace events still add log volume, so leave the switch disabled
outside a focused investigation.

Use the normal log files described in [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md) and remove
these switches from `.env` when the investigation ends.

### Event-wheel limits

These are tuning knobs rather than traces, read by `nevent_config_limit()` when
the event system initializes:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DURIS_NEVENT_BUDGET_USEC` | `25000` (25 ms) | Wall-clock budget for event callbacks per pulse. |
| `DURIS_NEVENT_MAX_CALLBACKS` | `0` (none) | Callback count cap per pulse. |
| `DURIS_NEVENT_CATCHUP_MAX_EXTENSION_USEC` | `5000` | Maximum time-budget extension while repaying deferred work. |
| `DURIS_NEVENT_CATCHUP_MAX_EXTRA_CALLBACKS` | `4000` | Maximum callback-cap extension while repaying deferred work. |
| `DURIS_NEVENT_PLAYER_PRIORITY` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable player-timed priority. |
| `DURIS_NEVENT_TRACE_PLAYER` | `0` | Set to `1` for per-player deadline timing logs. |
| `DURIS_NEVENT_ANALYTICS` | `0` | Set to `1` for 300-pulse scheduler and callback analytics. |

The wall-clock budget is the binding limit, and by default the only one. A
callback cap low enough that pulses end well inside the time budget starves the
wheel and builds a deferred backlog: the old default of 4000 ended full-world
pulses at a tenth of the time budget. A zero budget or callback cap disables that
one limit; zeroing both makes the scheduler intentionally unbounded and emits a
warning. Budget and callback values are limited to `0..1000000`, and boolean
switches to `0..1`; invalid values fall back to their defaults. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](../reference/ARCHITECTURE.md#event-wheel).

## Kingdom harvest node populations

`lib/duris.properties` sets the target population for each harvest region:

| Property | Shipped default |
| --- | --- |
| `kingdom.nodes.map.total` | `80.000` |
| `kingdom.nodes.ud.total` | `60.000` |

Each target counts all resource kinds together. The server clamps each target
between 0 and 500 nodes per region. These properties override the matching
compiled defaults; the population figures in `help kingdoms` describe the
shipped configuration.

## Precedence and verification

1. The launching process environment has precedence over `.env`.
2. `.env` values are loaded from the server's data directory, normally the
   repository root or the directory supplied with `-d`.
3. Missing values required by the selected persistence mode fail closed; no database
   credentials or names have compiled defaults.
4. The resolved database target must be present in `DB_ALLOWED_TARGETS` before
   a connection is attempted. Logs report validation categories without
   printing credentials or target values.
5. Boot verifies the connection and complete schema/migration contract before lookup
   publication, UID reservation, workers, listeners, or gameplay.

A configuration change generally requires a restart. Database credentials and
Redis settings are read before normal gameplay initialization; creation flags
are consulted when their menus or validation paths run, but restarting is the
simplest way to avoid stale process state.

See [README.md](../../README.md) for initial database creation,
[DATABASE.md](../reference/DATABASE.md) for schema and migration procedures, and
[ARCHITECTURE.md](../reference/ARCHITECTURE.md) for command-line and listener details.
