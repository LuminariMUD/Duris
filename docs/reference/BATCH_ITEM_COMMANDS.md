# Batch item commands

Duris supports several commands that select or move more than one item at a
time. This reference records the accepted syntax and the persistence boundary
behind it. The handlers in `src/cmd/actobj.c` and `src/cmd/actoth.c` remain
authoritative.

## Core syntax

`take` is a complete alias for `get`; both names dispatch to `do_get()`.

| Operation | Accepted batch syntax | Selection and destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pick up from a room | `get all`, `take all` | Every eligible visible floor object. |
| Pick up matching floor objects | `get all.<keyword>`, `take all.<keyword>` | Visible floor objects with that complete name keyword. |
| Empty one source into inventory | `get all [from] <container>`, `take all [from] <container>` | Every eligible item in one container. |
| Take matching contents | `get all.<keyword> [from] <container>`, `take all.<keyword> [from] <container>` | Matching contents of one container. |
| Put inventory into a container | `put all [in] <container>` | Every eligible carried object except the destination. Wallet coins are excluded. |
| Put matching inventory | `put all.<keyword> [in] <container>` | Matching eligible carried objects. |
| Drop inventory | `drop all` | Every eligible carried object. Wallet coins are excluded. |
| Drop matching inventory | `drop all.<keyword>` | Matching eligible carried objects. |
| Equip inventory | `wear all` | Tries carried items against empty slots in equipment-table order. |
| Unequip equipment | `remove all` | Tries every occupied slot and stops if inventory capacity is exhausted. |

The general argument parser discards fill words including `in`, `from`,
`with`, `the`, `on`, `at`, and `to`. The bracketed words above are therefore
optional, although the displayed forms are clearest. Phrases such as `out of`
are not parsed as a unit.

### Containers and corpses

For `get` and `take`, a source may be carried, worn, or on the room floor.
Valid source types are ordinary containers, storage containers, quivers, and
corpses. Resolution prefers a valid carried source, then a valid worn source,
then a valid room source.

Player and mobile corpses use the ordinary container grammar:

```text
get all corpse
take all corpse
get all.<keyword> corpse
take all.<keyword> corpse
```

An ordinal such as `2.corpse` selects one corpse when several share the
keyword. Player corpses additionally enforce their loot-delay, combat,
front-line, logging, revision, and corpse-file rules.

The token after `all` is always a source. Consequently, `get all <object>`
does not mean every object with that name and fails unless `<object>` is a
valid source. Use `get all.<keyword>` for a name-filtered floor batch.

For `put`, destination lookup covers carried and room objects, not worn
equipment. Containers, storage containers, quivers, and corpses are accepted
subject to their closed state, capacity, and item-type rules.

## Coins

Coins have two representations:

- A floor or container pile is an `ITEM_MONEY` object whose keyword is
  `coins`.
- Carried currency is stored in the character's copper, silver, gold, and
  platinum wallet balances, not in the carried-object list.

Ordinary get batches include money objects and convert each complete pile into
wallet balances. Coin-only selection uses the normal keyword form:

```text
get all.coins
take all.coins
get all.coins corpse
take all.coins corpse
```

`isname()` requires a complete keyword, so singular `all.coin` does not match
the canonical `coins` object. A pile is indivisible; there is no
`get <amount> <coin-type>` form.

Wallet currency leaves through explicit forms:

```text
put all.coins [in] <container>
put <amount> <coin-type> [in] <container>
drop all.coins
drop <amount> <coin-type>
```

`<coin-type>` is `copper`, `silver`, `gold`, or `platinum`; accepted prefixes
are resolved by `coin_type()`.

The dot is significant. `drop all.coins` empties the wallet, while
`drop all coins` is parsed as `drop all` and ignores the trailing word.
Likewise, `put all.coins bag` targets the wallet, while `put all coins bag`
treats `coins` as the destination name. Only the exact `all.coins` token enters
the wallet special case; `all.coin` is an ordinary item-keyword filter.

Other wallet batch operations do not pass through item ownership:

| Command | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `deposit all` | Move every wallet denomination into the bank. Container coins are excluded. |
| `deposit <amount> <coin-type>` | Move one denomination from wallet to bank. |
| `withdraw <amount> <coin-type>` | Move one denomination from bank to wallet; there is no `withdraw all`. |
| `give <amount> <coin-type> <player>` | Transfer one wallet denomination; there is no `give all`. |
| `split <amount> <coin-type>` | Split one wallet denomination among present group members. |

## Unsupported and separate forms

- `get all all` and `get <item> all` are rejected; one command cannot search
  multiple containers.
- `wear all.<keyword>` and `remove all.<keyword>` are not batch forms.
- `wield all`, `hold all`, `grab all`, `give all`, `sell all`, and
  `hide all` are not supported item batches.
- `junk all`, `bury all.<keyword>`, `donate all[.<keyword>]`, and
  `empty <source> <destination>` are legacy direct loops with their own
  eligibility rules. `junk all` currently returns immediately for untrusted
  characters and does not accept `all.<keyword>`; `bury all` without a keyword
  is rejected.
- Producing shops can create a bounded quantity with
  `buy <item> <container> <quantity>`; the quantity range is 1 through 50.
- `auction offer` supports 1 through 9 adjacent same-VNUM items, and
  `auction pickup` can return a listing's item batch. These use the auction
  transaction domain rather than the general movement adapter.

## Moving and saving

Every batch moves its items in memory at once. `get all`, `drop all`, `put all` and `empty`
select their items first, apply cumulative weight, count, space and quiver capacity as they go,
then move each selected item and report once. Binding, trap, hitch, no-loot, cursed, soulbound
and quiver rules remain command-specific. `empty` refuses the whole move if any item may not go
into the destination, and stops at the first item that does not fit. The next save of each
owner records where the items went.

- Get, put, drop, wear, remove, junk, empty: `src/cmd/actobj.c`
- Deposit, withdraw, split, bury, donate: `src/cmd/actoth.c`
- Money objects and keyword matching: `src/world/handler.c`
- Shops and auctions: `src/economy/shop.c`,
  `src/economy/auction_houses.c`
- Canonical money prototypes: `areas/obj/limbo.obj`, `areas_mini/mini.obj`
- Focused tests: `tests/async/test_bulk_get_publication.py`,
  `tests/async/test_corpse_haul.py`, `tests/async/test_actobj_get_limits.py`, and
  `tests/async/test_wear_all_regression.py`

## Asynchronous completion prompts

`src/net/comm.c::process_output()` leaves an ordinary command prompt pending
while item movement or currency publication reports the player busy, including
inbound transfers covered by those coordinators. Queued text and unrelated
asynchronous output still flush. Pager and string-editor prompts retain their
own behavior. The leading newline is chosen using the deferred-prompt state so
a delayed pickup preserves the synchronous byte ordering.

`test_item_movement_prompt_runtime.py` exercises real prompt generation and
Telnet/WebSocket text serialization with held coordinator completions, compact
and smart-prompt variants, combat, pager/editor and switched descriptors. It
uses fixture pickup text and transport endpoints; it is not a full browser
network or `do_get()` journey.
