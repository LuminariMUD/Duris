# Game-loop phase contract

`game_loop()` is the single game-thread owner of one server pulse.  The loop's
top level is intentionally an orchestration boundary: it prepares the pulse
context, invokes the named phases below in order, and leaves shutdown and
copyover handling after the pulse loop.  The helpers do not introduce a second
event loop, an async execution framework, or a new owner for descriptors,
queues, prompts, world state, or persistence receipts.

## Normal pulse order

The order is observable behavior and must be preserved when a phase is edited
or moved.  A phase may call existing subsystem owners, but it must not move
work across this table without a separate behavior change and trace evidence.

| Order | Helper | Owns | Ordering and lifetime contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `run_connection_phase` | Signal/lifecycle requests, persistence-log polling, readiness sets, hostname answers, `select`, async I/O, accepts, TLS negotiation, descriptor reads, and socket errors | Nonblocking readiness, accept draining, and TLS negotiation happen before session input. A failed readiness poll returns to the next pulse after restoring the signal mask. |
| 2 | `run_session_input_phase` | WebSocket/login timeouts and pings, wait/slow gates, asynchronous authentication completion, selective queue dequeue, and pager/editor/playing/nanny dispatch | Authentication type-ahead remains distinct from playing input. Casting/item-action and creation-grant gates are evaluated before dequeue; the existing command latency prologue ends before queue/gate work. |
| 3 | `run_output_phase` | Existing telnet/WebSocket bytes, partial writes, application output, control frames, prompt-related flush/close transitions, and queued ping completion | Retained bytes drain before new framing. Output remains before `ne_events()` and before recurring durable-completion publication. |
| 4 | `run_event_phase` | `ne_events()`, telemetry pulse accounting, creation-grant preparation, artifact mana, and device actions | `ne_events()` closes the current tick's pre-event scheduling window. Creation/artifact/device work remains after it. |
| 5 | `run_recurring_persistence_phase` | Every-two-pulse GMCP/ship, locker/corpse, critical completion routing, outbox publication, saves, load/recovery, caches, and maintenance completion delivery | Durable completions and outboxes retain their existing `pulse % 2` cadence and follow `ne_events()`. No completion is moved ahead of input or output. Maintenance completions remain before due activities. |
| 6 | `run_activity_phase`, then `run_combat_phase` | Due activities, violence, and descriptor-related map/group/movement updates | Activities precede combat exactly as before; descriptor traversal remains on the game thread and uses borrowed live pointers only for the duration of the phase. |
| 7 | `run_pulse_reset_phase` | Tick advance, due affect/point updates, latency diagnostics, trace snapshots, remaining-pulse wait, and end-of-pulse time refresh | The event tick advances after combat. The wait is bounded by the pulse budget and may return early on an interrupt; the next top-level pulse retries. |

The top-level call sequence is therefore:

```text
connection → session input → output → ne_events/artifact/device
          → recurring persistence/maintenance → activities → combat
          → tick/affects/points/diagnostics/wait
```

## Session input decision boundary

`session_input_route` is a small decision result, not a session or descriptor
owner.  `select_session_input()` decides whether a line is kept queued, pulled
from the restricted casting queue, pulled from the transaction-aware playing
queue, or pulled from the ordinary queue.  `dispatch_session_input()` then
hands the line to the existing pager, editor, playing interpreter, or nanny
handler.  Authentication work is checked separately because a password line is
not a playing command.

The decision preserves the existing distinctions:

- `PLR2_WAIT`, scheduled `event_wait`, casting, and active item-action gates
  control command eligibility without dropping ordinary type-ahead.
- Creation-grant admission blocks only playing commands; pre-entry nanny input
  continues through the login/creation flow.
- Charm/original-descriptor rules remain part of the playing eligibility check.
- Pager and editor input is routed by descriptor state, not parsed as a world
  command.  Playing commands continue through paging-aware dispatch.
- A completion can update live state while its output remains queued; output
  backpressure and descriptor lifetime stay with networking.

The pulse context contains only the per-pulse references needed by the existing
code: listener descriptors, scratch buffers, signal/time state, debug counters,
and trace measurements.  It is created and consumed within one game-thread
iteration.  No worker or completion path receives a descriptor pointer through
this boundary.

## Non-goals and verification

The phase helpers own no command metadata, socket ownership, queue capacity,
transaction admission, receipt identity, output formatting, or the number and
cadence of world and persistence calls.  No synchronous database work is part of
the pulse helper contract.

The phase contract is guarded by `tests/async/test_game_loop_phase_contract.py`
and the command-latency runtime/source contract.  Runtime coverage keeps the
existing casting, command-gate, authentication, item/currency queue, output,
telnet/WebSocket, and session-journey tests in the validation set.
