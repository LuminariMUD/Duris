# Critical Command Pipeline

Phase 02 non-idempotent gameplay work uses one bounded command contract. Each command
has a cryptographically random 128-bit operation ID, a schema and payload version, a
categorical source site and deadline, sorted affected entity keys, optional expected
revisions, and owned payload bytes. It contains no live game pointers, SQL, Redis keys,
paths, account names, or character names.

The generic destination stores command identity and result in an InnoDB inbox, applies
a typed test-domain mutation, and creates its notification in the same transaction.
Production gameplay producers remain disabled until their individual Phase 02 domain
sessions. Outside mini mode, startup requires the verified critical-command schema;
failure leaves critical gameplay stopped.

## Acceptance and execution

The coordinator validates and normalizes an envelope before admission. Entity keys
are sorted and duplicates are rejected. It reserves bounded memory, fences the
command's keys, and queues it on the one persistence writer
(`persistence_job_kind::critical`), the same thread that applies every save. A command
therefore lands in capture order with the saves around it: a save captured before the
command is applied before it, one captured after, after it. `submit()` returns
`accepted`; the command is durable once the writer has applied it. New commands are not
journaled: like a save, a command that had not reached the database is lost in a crash
(see the persistence reset plan, "What a crash costs"). Records are never coalesced or
replaced by a newer command.

The writer job carries its own copy of the command and of the apply function, so a
command queued before shutdown still lands after the coordinator has stopped; its
completion is then not delivered. The writer retries a lost connection, a lock wait or an
ambiguous commit at the head of its queue, before anything queued after the command,
exactly as it retries a save. Any other outcome is handed to the coordinator's
completion channel.

The state and transition table is deliberately split between the coordinator's
command lifecycle and a domain's live-publication lifecycle. The
`critical_completion_delivery` boundary owns bounded completion retention and
queue operations; the coordinator owns fencing and terminal transitions.
There is no second generic lifecycle framework hidden behind the domain adapters.

| State | Owner | Durable evidence and allowed transition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Queued on the writer | Coordinator plus the persistence writer | The operation is reserved in bounded memory and fenced on every key; the writer applies it in capture order through the typed domain adapter. A domain transaction/flat-file authority and its inbox/result are the durable evidence; the coordinator receives an exact revisioned completion. |
| Retried by the writer | Persistence writer | A lost connection, lock wait or ambiguous commit is applied again with the same operation ID before anything queued after it, until it lands. The fence remains. A command whose outcome never becomes known is named at shutdown with what the writer could not write. |
| Final notification retained | `critical_completion_delivery` plus coordinator pulse | The exact operation ID, outcome, and durable revision remain queued until the simulation-thread consumer supplies capacity. Consumer backpressure cannot cause a final result to be discarded; publication then releases or preserves the appropriate fence. |
| Currency publication ready | Game-thread currency adapter | The adapter stages the coordinator receipt under the same operation ID, then publishes the committed wallet/bank revision. Database completion may therefore precede live publication without a replacement operation. |
| Currency waiting / retrying / blocked | Game-thread currency adapter | An offline player waits, a transient callback retries within its bound, and an unresolved receipt remains blocked with its original continuation and ID. These are not coordinator retries and never become an automatic rejection or refund. |
| Snapshot pending and outbox pending | Snapshot and outbox subsystems | Snapshot capture/replay and outbox delivery have their own owners, records, and recovery rules. They do not coalesce critical commands or substitute for live currency publication. |

The writer applies commands one at a time in acceptance order, so conflicting commands
never overlap. The fence exists from acceptance until the game thread takes the
completion, or, for a command held for publication, until it acknowledges the
publication. `critical_command_coordinator_is_fenced()` reports it, so callers do not
build a command from a view another command is changing. A completion with the wrong
operation ID or attempt is stale and cannot release anything.

An identical duplicate submission attaches to the active operation or the bounded
recent-completion cache. Reusing an ID with different bytes fails closed. Accepted
commands cannot be cancelled. A terminal destination failure is reported once.

## Journal of an older server

Only a journal an older server left is read, once, at boot, from
`CRITICAL_COMMAND_JOURNAL_DIR`. Every record is validated first: a record this server
cannot execute stops the boot with nothing applied and the journal untouched. The
commands are then queued on the writer in journal order, and each is checkpointed once it
lands (a command held for publication, once its publication is acknowledged). Replay
retains the original operation ID; a command replayed again after a crash finds its
inbox row and returns `already_applied`.

The journal directory must be owned by the server user and mode `0700`; its regular
file is mode `0600` and opened without following symlinks. Records have magic, version,
length, operation ID, canonical command bytes, and CRC32. Exact checkpoint rewrites a
temporary file, syncs it, renames it, and syncs the directory. Truncation, bad framing,
unsupported versions, checksum mismatch, unsafe ownership or permissions, I/O failure,
or quota exhaustion fails closed. Identical repeated frames replay once; conflicting
bytes for one operation ID are corruption.

Default bounds are 1,024 active operations, 64 MiB of command memory, 2,048 pending
completion records, and a 256-operation/8 MiB recent-completion cache. Accepted work is
never dropped because the writer is behind.

## Lifecycle and diagnostics

Copyover and ordinary shutdown quiesce admission and require a three-second drain
before later persistence gates. The drain covers commands on the writer and retained
terminal notifications. Any failed transition resumes admission and leaves the live
server running. The game loop drains typed completions every two pulses. Submission
and pulse perform no file or database I/O on the game thread.

`world persistence` exposes one metadata-only `critical_commands` line: state,
in-flight and publication-pending counts, retained bytes, fences, recent completions,
high-water marks, accepts, attachments, outcomes, retries, ambiguous results, stale
completions, overloads, oldest age, and journal counts/bytes/status. It never prints
command payloads or entity identities.

The database inbox stores the canonical command/key hashes and authoritative result.
An identical duplicate returns that result; different bytes under the same operation ID
fail closed. Connection loss after `COMMIT` is reconciled by rereading the inbox before
the original immutable command can retry. Test-state rows are locked in normalized key
order. Deadlocks and lock waits are retryable with the same operation ID.

Each transaction also writes a bounded typed outbox record. The dispatcher reads at
most 64 records/4 MiB at a time, passes the stable outbox ID to a typed consumer, and
records consumer dedupe plus delivered state together. Retryable delivery uses bounded
backoff; the eighth failure or a terminal result retains a dead-letter row. Copyover and
shutdown drain commands first and outbox records second.

`world persistence` adds cached `critical_outbox` counts for pending age, dead letters,
incomplete inbox rows, committed operations missing outbox rows, delivery/retry/error
totals, and high-water records/bytes. `critical_outbox_reconcile()` is the typed
read-only discrepancy interface. `critical_outbox_retry_dead_letter(id)` is the sole
repair action: it can only reset one numeric dead-letter ID and never accepts SQL.

Treat a growing oldest age, `journal=corrupt`, `journal=io_failure`, or
`journal_quota=1` as a stop condition for copyover/shutdown and affected gameplay.
Restore the underlying storage or destination, preserve the journal, and investigate
before restarting. Never delete or edit the journal to clear a fence.

Focused validation is `python3 tests/async/test_critical_command_admission.py`,
`python3 tests/async/test_critical_command_coordinator.py`,
`python3 tests/async/test_critical_completion_capacity.py`,
`python3 tests/async/test_critical_transaction_contract.py`, and, on a disposable
database, `tests/async/run_critical_command_schema_mysql.sh`.

## Epic balance destination

Epic awards and spends use command type `epic` with one player key, a signed delta,
typed reason, optional reason ID, and a funds-required flag. The repository creates a
baseline lazily when needed, locks `player_data`, validates the revision and funds,
updates balance/revision, inserts one immutable ledger row, stores the exact result,
and emits its outbox row in the same transaction. Duplicate and ambiguous replay return
the stored balance/revision without another delta.

The game thread owns a bounded operation-keyed continuation table. It publishes the
exact committed balance and revision before invoking a typed staged effect. Offline
completions remain retained until the player enters or reconnects. `world persistence`
reports aggregate `epic_transactions` pending, retained, outcome, submission-failure,
and malformed-completion counters without operation or player identity.

Player checkpoints, legacy flat-file replay, and ordinary status updates do not write
the epic balance. New-character initialization and authoritative SQL hydration are the
only non-transactional in-memory assignments. Focused validation is
`python3 tests/async/test_epic_transaction_contract.py` and, on a guarded development
database, `tests/async/run_epic_transaction_schema_mysql.sh`.

## Currency receipt and live-publication boundary

The currency adapter gives every in-process continuation an explicit publication
state: awaiting coordinator completion, ready, waiting for its player, retrying a
bounded coin callback, or blocked on an unresolved receipt. It retains the
original operation ID and continuation when a receipt is ambiguous,
retry-exhausted, or acknowledges a commit whose result or live balances cannot
be validated. These states are **not** terminal rejection; they must not trigger
a failure/refund callback. A blocked entry is not scanned again on every pulse.
It emits one operation-ID-bearing diagnostic and sleeps until the coordinator
delivers another exact receipt. See [issue #380](https://github.com/Community-Duris/Duris/issues/380).

Coordinator completion and live publication have different lifetimes. A
non-rebasable debit must respect the domain's player/account busy state even
after the coordinator releases its execution fence. Rebasable rewards may queue
behind ordinary in-flight work because they do not read the live balance, but
stop for an affected player/account once publication is blocked. This prevents
a single unresolved receipt from filling the global `CURRENCY_PENDING_MAX`
table. Unrelated accounts retain their existing admission behavior.
Successful publication, or a known terminal rejection, removes the completed
pending entry before invoking its continuation. An extracted node owns callback
context across re-entrant submissions; no pending-map iterator survives that
callback.

A corrected exact receipt can finish a retained operation once without issuing a
new debit/credit. This is not automatic reconciliation tooling: an unresolved
receipt can continue to fence dependent gameplay until the original result is
recovered or the underlying fault is repaired. The fence deliberately includes
every online character for the same account and racewar: those characters share
one bank row, so a timeout or per-character bypass could spend an unpublished
balance. Do not clear the pending operation, add a timeout, or create a replacement
operation ID to conceal the fault. This in-process retention does not claim that
callback context becomes durable across restart; durable continuation ownership
belongs to the larger persistence refactor.

`world persistence` reports `currency_transactions` pending, retained-offline,
blocked-publication, callback-retry, outcome, malformed, submission-failure, and
abandoned-publication counts. Blocked, malformed, failed-submission, or abandoned
states make that line degraded; it exposes no account, player, or operation ID.

`python3 tests/async/test_currency_completion_retention.py` links the actual
adapter and codecs with controlled coordinator/live endpoints under ASan/UBSan
in both build modes. It covers malformed/ambiguous receipts, range validation,
offline re-entry, corrected/duplicate delivery, payload-free known rejection,
account/racewar guards, re-entrant callback chaining/rehashing, normal rebasable
admission, and blocked-publication admission.
`test_currency_input_queue.py` additionally covers real command-selection and coin
publication adapters. These tests do not by themselves prove SQL/flatfile storage
or complete player-journey parity.

## Physical coin custody

`coin_transfer_command` and the currency coordinator commit wallet and physical
pile changes together on both SQL and flat-file authority. Payload amounts,
UID/custody, owner revisions, conservation, overflow, and operation-ID replay
are checked before publication. The SQL parent receipt identifies both child
operation IDs in the same transaction. Saved item `coin_payload` preserves the
pile denominations for reload; ordinary snapshots do not create custody.

An untracked NPC-wallet or reset-created pile first passes the existing absent-item
admission path. Admission grants no money: wallet credit follows the separate
atomic pickup commit. Its continuation rechecks the original container UID,
location/accessibility, and custody, so moving the source during admission cannot
publish a stale pickup. Existing active/retired durable UID conflicts fail closed.

Flat-file coin publication updates the affected room projection in the same
authority transaction, including partial piles and container weights. Otherwise
a successful coin pickup could advance custody while leaving the next ordinary
item pickup unable to materialize the room revision.

Coin publication callbacks have at most eight attempts. On permanent publication
failure, `EOWNERDEAD` cleanup clears retained command context and retires pending
work without refunding an already committed debit or reporting it as rejected.
Durable custody and command evidence remain the recovery source. The focused
`test_coin_custody_lifecycle.py` and `test_currency_input_queue.py` harnesses and
`run_currency_transaction_schema_mysql.sh` cover this boundary.
