# Legacy Dump Import Guide

This is the handoff document for importing an old Duris MySQL dump into the current
development schema. It explains what is replaced, what is preserved verbatim, what is
normalized for the current server, where displaced source rows live, and which files own
each contract.

The short version is:

- the importer replaces one explicitly allow-listed local/development database; it is not
  a row-by-row merge tool;
- every source table must still exist after migration;
- unrelated website and administration tables may coexist with the game schema and keep
  their data;
- a source row removed from a canonical game table by required uniqueness cleanup must
  first be retained in a `legacy_import_*` archive;
- source values that the current runtime schema cannot represent are retained in a raw
  archive before a compatible runtime projection is produced; and
- the game still requires its exact positive runtime contract. Extra imported tables do
  not weaken that check.

Never point this process at production. The importer deliberately accepts only a loopback,
non-production target whose exact `host/database` pair appears in `DB_ALLOWED_TARGETS`.

## Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Source table | A base table restored directly from the supplied dump. |
| Runtime table | One of the canonical game tables required by the current server. |
| Extension table | A source table used by the website, administration tools, or an older subsystem, but not owned by the game runtime contract. |
| Preservation archive | A `legacy_import_*` table containing source rows that cannot remain verbatim in a canonical runtime table. |
| Legacy migration | The additive 145-step upgrade in `migrations/run_migration.sh`. |
| Immutable migration | A checksummed post-baseline migration in `migrations/immutable/`. |

## End-to-end flow

| Stage | What happens | Failure behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Validate | Check the environment file, dump, target, permissions, and explicit `--replace` acknowledgment. | Stop before touching the database. |
| 2. Quiesce check | Refuse the import if another connection is using the target database. | Stop before backup or replacement. |
| 3. Backup | Write an owner-only `mysqldump` of the current target, including routines, events, and triggers. | Stop before replacement. |
| 4. Replace | Drop target views/tables and stream the source dump into the same database. | Restore the backup when the failure is caught by the importer. |
| 5. Converge | Run the legacy migration, adopt/advance the immutable ledger, and reach migration head `0008_statistics_date_index`. | Restore the backup when the failure is caught by the importer. |
| 6. Verify runtime | Check the migration ledger and the exact metadata of all 174 runtime tables for MySQL 8 or MariaDB 10.11. | Restore the backup. |
| 7. Verify preservation | Require all source tables, reject unexplained row loss, validate known archives, and require extension-table row counts to remain equal. | Restore the backup. |
| 8. Verify materialization | Resolve the active object/mobile sources and reject selectable character item topology, pet bounds, unknown prototypes, or pet/owner room mismatches that the runtime materializers would refuse. | Restore the backup before the database can be exposed to gameplay. |

The implementation entrypoint is
[`scripts/import_legacy_dump.py`](../../scripts/import_legacy_dump.py). The commands it runs,
in order, are:

```text
migrations/run_migration.sh
scripts/migration_runner.py run
migrations/verify_runtime_compatibility.sh
scripts/character_materialization_readiness.py
```

## Safety gates

The importer fails closed unless all of these are true:

- `--replace` was supplied;
- the environment file and dump are regular, non-symlink files with mode `0600` or
  stricter;
- `ENVIRONMENT` is `local`, `development`, `dev`, or `test`;
- `DB_HOST` is `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or `::1`;
- `DB_NAME` is a safe identifier and does not look like a production name;
- `DB_ALLOWED_TARGETS` contains the exact `DB_HOST/DB_NAME` pair;
- the database port is valid and any configured socket path is absolute;
- the dump begins with a recognized `mysqldump` header;
- the dump does not contain a leading `CREATE DATABASE`, `DROP DATABASE`, or `USE`
  directive that could redirect the import; and
- no other connection is using the target database.

The default backup location is:

```text
tmp/legacy-import-backups/<database>-<UTC timestamp>.sql
```

Both the backup directory and backup file are owner-only. The importer prints the exact
backup path and source SHA-256 on success.

## Dump portability changes

The source dump is streamed; it is not rewritten on disk. On non-`INSERT` lines only,
the importer makes two compatibility substitutions:

| Source metadata | Imported metadata | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` | `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` | MariaDB 10.11 does not provide MySQL 8's `0900` collation. |
| A dump-owned ``DEFINER=`user`@`host` `` | `DEFINER=CURRENT_USER` | A historical view definer may not exist on the target. |

`INSERT INTO` lines are passed through byte-for-byte, so a string value that happens to
contain either token is not changed. The legacy migration later converts existing base
tables to the configured database character set/collation and normalizes canonical table
metadata. Extension-table data is preserved, but its storage engine or collation may be
modernized by that legacy migration.

## Source-to-destination rules

### Default rule

Every source base table remains under its source name. The importer rejects a missing
source table after migration. A source row-count reduction is rejected unless that table
has an explicit archive rule below.

For extension tables, the final row count must exactly equal the restored source row
count. Extension tables are deliberately excluded from runtime metadata fingerprints;
they are preserved data, not newly adopted game-server dependencies.

The source `players_view` view is restored/recreated separately and is not counted as a
base table.

### Explicit preservation and projection rules

| Source | Trigger | Canonical result | Preservation destination |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `account_characters` | More than one row has the same `char_name`. | Keep the lowest-`pid` row required by the unique character-name contract. | Only the discarded higher-`pid` rows are copied to `legacy_import_account_characters`. |
| `player_item_extra_descr` | Duplicate `(item_id, keyword, LEFT(description, 255))`. | Keep the lowest-`id` row and add `uk_item_descr`. | Copy the complete source table to `legacy_import_player_item_extra_descr` before cleanup. |
| `player_pet_item_extra_descr` | Duplicate `(item_id, keyword, LEFT(description, 255))`. | Keep the lowest-`id` row and add `uk_pet_item_descr`. | Copy the complete source table to `legacy_import_player_pet_item_extra_descr` before cleanup. |
| `player_item_affects` | Duplicate `(item_id, location, modifier)`. | Keep the lowest-`id` row and add `uk_item_affect`. | Copy the complete source table to `legacy_import_player_item_affects` before cleanup. |
| `player_pet_item_affects` | Duplicate `(item_id, location, modifier)`. | Keep the lowest-`id` row and add `uk_pet_item_affect`. | Copy the complete source table to `legacy_import_player_pet_item_affects` before cleanup. |
| Legacy `server_reboots` with an `id` column | The launcher-era table predates immutable migration 0004. | Convert to the canonical `record_id` table and supported lifecycle values. | Copy every raw source row to `legacy_import_server_reboots`, using `source_id` for the old `id`. |
| `account_banks` plus bank values derivable from player rows | A bank row already exists for `(account_name, racewar)`. | The imported `account_banks` row remains authoritative; derived rows fill only missing keys via `INSERT IGNORE`. | No separate archive is needed because the imported row is not overwritten. |

The four item-metadata archives are created only when duplicates exist. They contain the
complete source table, not merely the discarded rows, so a developer can reconstruct the
exact pre-deduplication state. The account-character archive is different: it contains
only rows that the uniqueness cleanup would discard.

### `server_reboots` projection

The raw archive retains `source_id`, `boot_time`, nullable `shutdown_time`, nullable
`uptime_seconds`, the original `shutdown_type`, `initiated_by`, `reason`, and `created_at`.
The runtime projection then applies these rules:

- old `id` becomes canonical `record_id`;
- negative epoch/duration values are clamped to zero;
- a null `shutdown_time` becomes the non-negative `boot_time`;
- a null `uptime_seconds` is derived from shutdown minus boot time, or becomes zero;
- supported types remain unchanged: `shutdown`, `reboot`, `copyover`, `autoreboot`,
  `pwipe`, `hung`, `autoreboot_copyover`, `crash`, and `unknown`;
- any other type becomes `unknown` in the runtime table; and
- legacy `created_at` has no canonical runtime column and therefore remains in the raw
  archive only.

The archive is the source of truth when investigating a pre-import lifecycle value. The
canonical table is the source of truth for current server operation.

## Runtime versus extension ownership

The current schema contract has two layers:

1. The baseline requires a positive inventory of 170 canonical tables.
2. Immutable migrations add, change and drop tables after it.
   [RUNTIME_COMPATIBILITY.md](RUNTIME_COMPATIBILITY.md) states the current head and
   table count. Convergence must reach that head: both its ledger identity and the
   full runtime inventory are enforced at boot.

The baseline and runtime checks ask whether every required table and its expected metadata
is present. They do not require unrelated tables to be absent. This distinction lets a
combined game/website dump survive while missing, renamed, or modified game tables still
prevent migration adoption and server boot.

The authoritative inventories are:

- baseline tables: [`migrations/migration_manifest.json`](../../migrations/migration_manifest.json);
- all runtime tables: [`migrations/data_lifecycle_manifest.json`](../../migrations/data_lifecycle_manifest.json);
- normalized runtime metadata and migration head:
  [`migrations/runtime_compatibility_manifest.json`](../../migrations/runtime_compatibility_manifest.json); and
- the compiled boot contract:
  [`src/core/runtime_compatibility_contract.h`](../../src/core/runtime_compatibility_contract.h).

[`scripts/validate_runtime_compatibility.py`](../../scripts/validate_runtime_compatibility.py)
cross-checks those inventories so they cannot drift independently.

## Reference import: `prod.sql`, 2026-08-31

This section records the completed import that established this process. Counts describe
the database immediately after migration and before normal server activity added new
lifecycle rows.

| Audit item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Source file | `tmp/session14-gate/prod.sql` |
| Source/target engines | MySQL 8 dump imported into local MariaDB 10.11 `duris_dev` |
| Source size | 345,366,975 bytes |
| Source SHA-256 | `8f882d16be743b42467890f7714052d64b1cf8eca75be89c77efaeb3d7e5cc44` |
| Source inventory | 190 base tables, one view, 1,757,000 rows |
| Source/runtime overlap | 112 tables |
| Source extension inventory | 78 tables |
| Immediate post-migration inventory | 254 base tables, 1,773,767 rows |
| Runtime contract | 173 tables; migration count 5 at `0005_level_cap_singleton`, the head on the run date. A repeat of this import today must converge to the current head. |
| Added preservation archives | Three: two item-description archives and the reboot archive |
| Missing source tables | None |
| Unexpected source row reductions | None |
| Extension preservation | All 78 tables had equal row counts and equal database `CHECKSUM TABLE` results against an exact normalized raw restore |
| Account-bank comparison | All 120 rows matched, including timestamps compared as Unix epochs |

The run retained owner-only pre-import backups named
`duris_dev-20260831T044313Z.sql` and `duris_dev-20260831T044859Z.sql` under the
default backup directory. These are ignored local recovery artifacts, not repository
assets; a future operator must use the backup path printed by their own run.

Only two canonical source tables lost duplicate rows, and their complete source contents
remain archived:

| Table | Source rows | Canonical rows | Archived source rows |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `player_item_extra_descr` | 289,015 | 16,072 | 289,015 |
| `player_pet_item_extra_descr` | 441 | 36 | 441 |

The source had 648 `server_reboots` rows. All 648 were present in both the initial
canonical projection and `legacy_import_server_reboots`. The archive retained nine rows
with null shutdown fields and 14 rows using the legacy `web_stop`/`web_restart` types.
Those values were normalized only in the canonical projection. After the service was
restarted during verification, the canonical table contained 652 rows because four new
runtime lifecycle records had been written; the archive correctly remained at 648.

No duplicate item-affect or account-character cleanup reduced rows in this reference
import, so their conditional archive tables were not needed.

The final code and imported database passed the focused Python tests, full legacy
migration/replay/bootstrap-equivalence tests on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11, runtime
compatibility tests on both engines, the C++20 server build, the standalone verifier,
and a live service health check reporting persistence `ready`.

### Preserved extension-table inventory

These 78 source tables were retained outside the game runtime contract. Names are listed
exactly as imported; in particular, legacy `prepstatment_duris_sql` is distinct from the
canonical `prepstatement_duris_sql` table.

## Operator runbook

### 1. Confirm the target

Review `.env` without copying credentials into logs or documentation. At minimum, the
configuration must describe a local target and explicitly allow it:

```dotenv
ENVIRONMENT=local
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_NAME=duris_dev
DB_ALLOWED_TARGETS=127.0.0.1/duris_dev
```

The file must also contain `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWD`. Keep `.env` at mode `0600` and do
not commit it.

### 2. Quiesce the database

Stop the game and any website/job process connected to the target. For the local user
service used by this repository:

```bash
systemctl --user stop duris-mud.service
systemctl --user is-active duris-mud.service
```

The second command should report `inactive`. The importer independently checks live
database connections and refuses to proceed if another one remains.

### 3. Protect and identify the dump

```bash
chmod 600 /path/to/legacy.sql
sha256sum /path/to/legacy.sql
```

Record the checksum in the migration ticket or handoff notes. Do not commit the dump.

### 4. Run the guarded replacement

```bash
python3 scripts/import_legacy_dump.py \
  --env-file .env \
  --replace \
  /path/to/legacy.sql
```

Use `--backup-dir /private/path` when the default ignored repository directory is not an
appropriate backup destination. A successful final line reports source table/row counts,
the dump checksum, and backup path.

The final import gate is the same read-only check available to operators:

```bash
python3 scripts/character_materialization_readiness.py --env-file .env
```

It reports aggregate counts only. A nonzero finding count prevents import completion and
causes the importer to restore its pre-import backup. The gate resolves prototypes from
the active `areas/AREA` object and mobile sources, applies saved item-type overrides when
checking parent topology, and enforces the runtime pet bounds and owner-room equality.

### Existing-data materialization repair

Do not use the repair mode as a general normalization step. First restore a fresh
production backup into an isolated, loopback, non-production clone, configure `.env` for
that clone, and keep the game and every writer stopped. Create the exact row manifest only
inside an existing owner-only directory:

```bash
install -d -m 0700 /private/duris-materialization-repair
python3 scripts/character_materialization_readiness.py \
  --env-file .env \
  --write-manifest /private/duris-materialization-repair/affected.tsv
sha256sum /private/duris-materialization-repair/affected.tsv
```

The manifest is owner-only and is the only output containing player, item, or pet
identifiers. Review it on the protected host. Take a new `scripts/backup_pfiles.sh` backup
of the clone, record its SHA-256, then apply only when the current findings, manifest,
database name, and backup all match exactly:

```bash
python3 scripts/character_materialization_readiness.py \
  --env-file .env \
  --apply \
  --manifest /private/duris-materialization-repair/affected.tsv \
  --manifest-sha256 <manifest-sha256> \
  --backup /absolute/path/to/clone-backup.sql.gz \
  --backup-sha256 <backup-sha256> \
  --confirm-database <clone-database-name> \
  --receipt /private/duris-materialization-repair/clone-receipt.txt
```

The transaction clears only manifested stale item-type overrides, copies each manifested
owner room to its pet, and clamps only a manifested over-limit hit value. It fingerprints
every unaffected `player_data`, `player_items`, `player_pets`, and `player_pet_items` row
before and after the DML and rolls the transaction back if any fingerprint or expected
row count changes. Re-run the readiness command, the real player-load repository harness,
and the full server materialization path for every protected-manifest owner on the clone.
Preserve aggregate success logs and the receipt; never copy identifiers into the ticket.
The repository harness accepts the protected manifest without printing its rows:

```bash
PLAYER_LOAD_ENV_FILE=.env \
PLAYER_LOAD_MANIFEST_PATH=/private/duris-materialization-repair/affected.tsv \
tests/async/run_player_load_repository_mysql.sh
```

The 2026-09-04 rehearsal used a fresh disposable MariaDB 10.11 clone of the
preserved production-derived reference import. The protected manifest contained
19 repair rows affecting 17 selectable characters. The guarded transaction
cleared 16 stale item-type overrides and repaired three pet rows, after which
the readiness audit reported zero findings and the real repository harness
loaded all 17 snapshots. Every unaffected row in `player_data`, `player_items`,
`player_pets`, and `player_pet_items` was byte-identical before and after the
transaction. The current C++ item/pet materializer harness also accepted the
repaired topology, room, and hit-bound cases. Restoring the exact fresh backup
returned the clone to 19 findings across the same 17-character aggregate.

The reference import also retains 38 pet-item payload rows that predate durable
object UIDs. Because they have neither a UID nor custody authority, the loader
keeps them stored for explicit recovery but counts and skips them during
materialization. This repair does not fabricate ownership for those rows.

For production, repeat classification against the still-quiesced live target, obtain the
owner's explicit authorization, create and validate a fresh production backup, and use a
new manifest and receipt. Add `--authorize-production-repair` to record that explicit
authorization acknowledgment; the utility rejects that flag on a non-production target.
A stale clone manifest is intentionally rejected. Afterward,
run the runtime compatibility checks, start the service, verify health, inspect refusal
logs, and retain the backup through the soak. Roll back by restoring that exact backup
while writers remain stopped; do not attempt inverse DML.

### 5. Verify before exposing gameplay

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_runtime_compatibility.py
./migrations/verify_runtime_compatibility.sh
make -C src
systemctl --user start duris-mud.service
./scripts/healthcheck.sh
```

The health endpoint is acceptable only when its payload is:

```json
{"status":"healthy","persistence":"ready"}
```

Keep the pre-import backup until the migrated system has passed the required gameplay and
website acceptance checks.

## What the automatic proof does and does not establish

The importer automatically proves:

- every source base table remains present;
- no source table has fewer rows unless it uses a known archive rule;
- required deduplication archives contain enough rows to reconstruct the source;
- each source extension table has the same row count after migration;
- the immutable ledger is complete and internally checksummed; and
- every runtime table matches the expected engine, collation, columns, defaults, indexes,
  and foreign keys for the detected database engine.

The importer does not perform a cryptographic value-level comparison of every canonical
row because canonical migrations intentionally transform some schemas and values. For a
high-risk import, repeat the stronger reference audit in a disposable database: restore
the dump without running migrations, compare every extension table with `CHECKSUM TABLE`,
and perform domain-specific canonical comparisons such as account-bank rows and archive
counts. Never weaken the canonical verifier merely to make an old dump pass.

Normal runtime activity changes counts after startup. In particular, `server_reboots`,
logs, audit tables, and lookup publication state may no longer match the immediate
post-import snapshot.

## Failure and recovery

If a normal import, migration, or verification command fails after replacement begins,
the importer drops the partial target objects and restores the pre-import backup. It
reports the original failure after recovery.

If automatic restore also fails, the error prints the exact backup path. Keep the game
stopped, preserve both the source dump and backup, and restore only after reconfirming the
target database. Do not improvise a merge into the partial database.

An external interruption such as process termination or host failure may bypass the
normal caught-error recovery path. Treat the target as partial until the pre-import backup
has been restored and the runtime verifier passes. The backup is the old target state; it
is not a second copy of the incoming legacy dump.

## Troubleshooting decisions

| Symptom | Correct response |
| --- | --- |
| Target is rejected | Fix `ENVIRONMENT`, loopback host, database name, or the exact `DB_ALLOWED_TARGETS` entry. Do not relax the check. |
| Active connections are reported | Stop the game, website, workers, and SQL sessions using that database, then retry from the beginning. |
| A source table is missing | Treat it as import/migration failure and restore. Do not add it to an ignore list. |
| An extension row count changed | Identify the migration touching that table. Preserve the source data or narrow the migration; do not classify it as runtime merely to bypass the check. |
| A new deduplication is required | Add a deliberate `legacy_import_*` archive before cleanup and teach the importer how to verify it. |
| A legacy value cannot fit the runtime schema | Preserve the raw row first, then define and test an explicit canonical projection. |
| Runtime metadata verification fails | Compare the live runtime table against the appropriate MySQL 8/MariaDB 10.11 contract. Extra extension tables are not the cause. |
| Import was interrupted | Assume partial state and recover from the named backup before restarting services. |
