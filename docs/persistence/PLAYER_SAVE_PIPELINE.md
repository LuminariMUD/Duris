# Player Save Pipeline

Memory is the authority. The database is a copy that catches up through one writer:

1. The game thread marks the affected component bits and seals an immutable snapshot
   only when dirty work exists.
2. The snapshot goes straight to the one persistence writer, and the character is
   clean again: the writer has it.
3. The writer is a single background thread (`src/player/player_save_worker.c`). It
   applies every queued save in capture order: player saves (with their pets),
   corpse saves, locker saves and saved room items. A newer save of the same owner
   replaces its queued one and goes to the back of the queue.
4. The game pulse consumes typed completions. A lost connection never reaches it:
   the writer retries that job at the head of the queue, with a backoff capped at
   five seconds. Any other failure is reported once, the job is dropped, and the
   owner is marked dirty so its next save carries the state again.

The game-thread checkpoint and completion paths perform no MySQL, Redis, or filesystem
operation. Nothing is journaled; see [Player Save Journal](PLAYER_SAVE_JOURNAL.md) for
the one-time replay of a journal left by an older server. A crash loses whatever had
not reached the database, at most one 30-second `dirty-player-checkpoint`.

## What a save writes

A save never refuses. In one transaction it writes what its owner holds in memory and
makes `item_current_owner` agree (`claim_items()` in `src/item/item_claim_repository.c`;
the flat-file backend does the same in `flatfile_item_repository_prepare_claim()` and
commits it with the player file):

- an item with no ownership row gets one;
- a row naming this owner is corrected if the item moved;
- a row naming anyone else (a player, corpse, locker, room or pet) is taken, and an
  `item_owner_audit` row records the item, its vnum, the old owner, the new owner and
  the time (flat-file: a line in `logs/log/item_claims`);
- a row naming an auction, a shopkeeper or the collector is left alone: the item and
  its contents are left out of the save and logged to `logs/log/dupes`. The economy
  still moves items through its own transactions until Phase 2 of the persistence
  reset, so the database is right about what it holds;
- a coin pile keeps whatever ownership the currency transactions gave it: it is
  written, and recorded if nobody has recorded it, but never taken or revived.

The owner's revision, and the revision of each owner that lost an item, advances once
per save that changes them. There is no revision fence: with one writer, every save is
newer than the last one for that owner. A character with no `player_data` row yet gets
one. Only the one-time replay of an older server's journal keeps the fence.

`logs/log/dupes` has one line per item a save left out, naming the item, its vnum,
the owner that lost it and the owner that has it.

## Configuration And Health

The writer needs no configuration. `world persistence` reports the pipeline (marks,
captures, replacements, unchanged checkpoints, write failures, terminal waits, drain
failures, legacy journal replay) and the writer (queued and in-flight jobs, bytes,
oldest age, high-water marks, connection retries, failures, capture-to-apply and apply
latency). Output contains no player identity or snapshot value.

## Persistence reporting severity

`persistence_report(severity, level, domain, owner, item_uid, event_id, action, format, ...)`
separates event severity from the immortal audience selected by `level`:

| Severity | Structured outcome | Routing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `persistence_severity::ok` | `outcome=ok` | `LOG_FILE` and `LOG_WIZ` file records |
| `persistence_severity::info` | `outcome=info` | `LOG_FILE` and `LOG_WIZ` file records |
| `persistence_severity::alert` | `outcome=alert` | Both file records and the existing red immortal broadcast |

`persistence_alert(...)` remains an alert-only compatibility entry point. Unknown
severity values also alert. Both entry points use the same category sanitization
and numeric-only detail filtering; owner, item UID and event ID arguments are
omitted from the output at every severity.

Use `ok` after a successful durable operation and `info` for expected progress.
Death recovery/disposition completion and durable disposition recording are `ok`.
Ordinary custody waits, undisputed in-flight transfers and successfully submitted
corpse-item restarts are `info`. Automatic raising skipped while corpse ownership
is pending is also informational. Failed restart submissions, disputes, missing
corpses, abandoned recovery, event scheduling failures and failed saves remain
alerts. A custody wait still escalates after 30 seconds and once per subsequent
30-second window; normal polls now use `outcome=info` in the file records.

Successful deferred-save flushes, flat fallback writes and complete legacy replays
also use `ok`; failed flushes and partial replays retain alerts. Retired raw-worker
and raw-replay status reports use `info`. Failed I/O, rejected mutations, dropped
or undrained work, unavailable workers and automatic restarts after worker failure
continue to alert even when a recovery path is available.

File delivery runs on a dedicated worker started during boot. Admission uses a fixed
128-record queue and a try-lock: the game loop never opens, writes, closes, or waits
for a reporting file. Each record is bounded to 4095 bytes; the reporter bounds
numeric details to 1023 bytes and the formatted event to 2047 bytes. Formatting may
truncate long numeric details. The worker receives only copied text and enqueue
time; it never accesses characters, descriptors, or the legacy `logit` formatter.

A full or contended queue rejects the new file record and increments `rejected`;
there is no synchronous fallback. Alert broadcasts still run immediately even if
file admission fails. `world persistence` exposes cumulative accepted/completed,
rejected, and independent file/wiz failure counters. The game pulse broadcasts a
reporting-delivery alert when failures increase or pending delivery makes no progress
for 30 seconds, at most once per 30 seconds. These notices do not re-enter the queue.
Counters remain inspectable when no immortal was online for the notice.

The worker creates missing parent directories, opens each sink with append and
close-on-exec, and accepts only regular files. Open, short-write, write, and close
failures are counted per sink; the other sink is still attempted. No ambiguous write
is replayed, so a partial write may leave a truncated record. Rename/create rotation
is supported: a record goes to the file opened for that append and subsequent opens
follow the new path. Use rename/create rotation; concurrent copytruncate cannot
promise lossless records. The two sinks are independent, not an atomic transaction.

Shutdown and copyover wait up to three seconds for queued and in-flight attempts.
A timeout reports possible diagnostic loss to stderr and does not veto authoritative
save/recovery gates. A failed exec leaves the worker available. Worker storage lives
until process exit, avoiding an unbounded destructor join if filesystem I/O hangs.
These diagnostic records are not a durable gameplay journal: no fsync or crash replay
is promised. Failure counts are also printed on ordinary shutdown.

Validate bounded admission, blocked I/O, independent sink failures, rotation, and
drain behavior with `python3 tests/async/test_persistence_log.py`.

Validate routing and privacy with `python3 tests/async/test_persistence_severity.py`;
`test_death_recovery_alert_level.py` also verifies the timed stall escalation.

## Terminal Saves And Process Drain

Destructive player transitions mark and capture a fresh full revision with the
current terminal intent and room behind a fixed-capacity terminal fence. An ACKed
nonterminal retry or an older pending full snapshot cannot authorize a new camp.
A caller may extract the character only after the exact
revision receives a database acknowledgement or, where explicitly allowed, after its
journal record has been synced. Older completions cannot release a newer fence. A
deadline failure keeps the fence and dirty revision retryable; later mutations advance
that same fence instead of becoming untracked.

Copyover and ordinary shutdown quiesce new checkpoint admission and wait to a bounded
deadline until every accepted snapshot is journal-durable. The drain includes a record
currently owned by the journal dispatcher, not only records still visible in its queue.
If the deadline expires, the transition is cancelled and the live server resumes
checkpoint admission.

`world persistence` reports admission, append-in-flight, terminal outcome, timeout,
and drain-failure counters without player identity. New legacy player flat-fallback
writes are retired; existing files remain untouched for compatibility and operator
recovery. Locker fallback behavior remains a separate compatibility boundary.

## Compatibility Boundary

New characters without a durable PID, locker characters, and Phase 02 critical
transactions retain their explicit legacy compatibility route for now. Synchronous
transactional compatibility saves advance `save_revision` in the same transaction,
fencing every older immutable snapshot. They are not treated as an exactly-once
gameplay command; Phase 02 replaces them with operation-keyed domains.

## Deferred and manual saves

`src/cmd/actoth.c::persistence_pulse_character_saves()` services deferred capture
and manual acknowledgement checks from the game-loop persistence path, independent
of world-event debt. It attempts at most 32 due deferred saves per call with a
round-robin cursor and checks the bounded 512-slot manual-status table. Deferred
slots use monotonic due times and character runtime identities so storage reuse
cannot apply work to a different character. Manual completion still requires
acknowledgement within the existing 30-second deadline.

A failed camp retains the live character and permits automatic nonterminal retry;
a later camp must capture its own intent again. Flat-file terminal saves require
authority acknowledgement; SQL-backed callers may explicitly permit a synced
journal handoff. These guarantees do not prevent legitimate storage timeouts or
operating-system starvation. The controlled retry/crash modes are documented in
[Testing](../guides/TESTING.md#full-world-save-diagnostics).

## Disputed player deaths

A refused corpse handoff records a per-player runtime dispute. The death retry
captures the corpse, refused inventory, wallet-conversion evidence, and observed
custody in one bounded death snapshot. SQL applies `player_death_disposition`,
`player_death_custody`, quarantine of remaining player-owned custody, and the
cleared player snapshot in one transaction. Flat-file authority publishes the
same effects with `player-deaths/<pid>-<revision>.death` in its recoverable
authority transaction. Successfully transferred corpse-owned items stay active;
quarantine includes remaining durable-only descendants.

Release requires durability for the death revision. Capture/admission failure,
a missing corpse, or a failed durability fence retains live assets for retry.
If event admission fails, the live player's fallback due time is serviced by the
game pulse. A two-second terminal wait is one attempt's budget, not a bound on
total death recovery. Restart replay applies journaled death evidence idempotently;
the runtime dispute flag itself is not durable evidence before journal admission.

A death disposition preserves evidence, not automatic restitution. Later ordinary
saves cannot overwrite it. SQL and file death stores are protected recovery data
in the [lifecycle manifest](../../migrations/data_lifecycle_manifest.json); retention
continues until recovery is resolved and the controller approves a purge horizon.
Do not treat these files as rotating logs. See `test_death_item_custody_contract.py`,
`test_player_snapshot_capture.py`, `test_player_save_pipeline.py`, and the isolated
`run_player_death_disposition_mysql.sh` suite for the relevant boundaries.

### Corpse creation batches (#174)

Registered carried roots and their nested contents are captured in one immutable
`corpse_create` command, within the existing item count and payload size bounds.
The command advances player/corpse custody revisions together. Publication checks
every captured node and live containment link before advancing the registry or
moving any root. A stale live topology retains the committed movement and its
busy fence; it does not release the player or publish a partial corpse.

After publication, the death callback writes the complete corpse once and advances
the existing retry event to the next game pulse. The retry still checks currency
and item work, disputes, and terminal-save durability before extraction. This
avoids extracting the actor inside the coordinator completion dispatcher. Pending
currency/reward work remains fenced, and event-admission failure retains the
existing allocation-free pulse fallback.

Legacy roots without runtime ownership entries retain the existing single-root
adoption path before the remaining registered roots are batched. Non-transient
admission refusal enters disputed-death disposition; transient admission conflicts
remain retryable. Disposition is durable evidence, not automatic restitution.
No absolute production latency guarantee follows from the batch change: database
latency, pending currency, and the final corpse snapshot still contribute.

`test_corpse_creation_batch.py` runs production admission, codec, registry, and
publication code under ASan/UBSan with nested 1/15/100-root fixtures, refusals,
pending coin work, stale topology, and duplicate completions. The combat journey
also runs with boons enabled and checks ordinary recovery, conservation, disputed
custody evidence before release, and exactly-once death consequences on restart.

The [corpse batch verification guide](../operations/corpse-creation-batches.md)
documents the real MariaDB character journey, isolated database setup, and the
minimal-world restart coverage limits.
