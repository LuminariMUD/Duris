# Immutable Migration Ledger

Duris has two deliberately separate histories:

- `migrations/run_migration.sh` is the legacy additive upgrade path. Its 145 progress
  steps and `mud_schema_migrations` data-copy markers are not complete historical
  execution evidence and are never backfilled as if they were.
- `migrations/migration_manifest.json` is the authoritative immutable history after
  the baseline. Every post-baseline step receives one ordered ID, apply file,
  verifier, compatibility label, and exact SHA-256 hashes.

## Honest baseline adoption

The checked-in baseline identifies the exact 170-table authoritative contract by a
sealed positive table inventory and sorted-name fingerprint. A fresh bootstrap and a
fully completed legacy upgrade must contain that complete inventory. Unrelated tables
from a combined game/website dump may coexist without weakening the canonical check.
Only then may an operator record either
`fresh_bootstrap` or `verified_legacy_adoption` in `mud_schema_baselines`.

The legacy runner creates the ledger and attempts verified adoption only after its last
schema operation. Extra, missing, or renamed tables refuse adoption. This creates one
honest observation at the current boundary; it does not invent timestamps or checksums
for historical steps.

For a fresh isolated database:

```sh
mysql "$DB_NAME" < migrations/bootstrap_multithread_safe.sql
python3 scripts/migration_runner.py inspect
python3 scripts/migration_runner.py adopt --kind fresh_bootstrap
python3 scripts/migration_runner.py run
```

By default, the runner requires `ENVIRONMENT` to be local/development/test, a loopback `DB_HOST`,
a non-production database name, and explicit credentials. After the exact production backup has
passed on a disposable clone, an owner-authorized production `run` additionally requires the exact
`--confirm-production-target HOST/DB` and a fresh owner-only
`--production-backup /absolute/path.sql.gz`. Production baseline adoption remains prohibited, and
the runner refuses to apply while another connection is using the configured database.

[RUNTIME_COMPATIBILITY.md](RUNTIME_COMPATIBILITY.md) states the current head and the
runtime table count. After the head is applied, the history singleton records the
applied count plus the exact history checksum. If a pre-b029
launcher already created the legacy `server_reboots`
shape, 0004 copies every lifecycle row into the canonical table and atomically
swaps it into place; an interrupted conversion can be retried without making the
legacy table unavailable or duplicating rows. 0006 creates the guild kingdom
realm table with a guarded `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and then converges a
database that already ran the deleted pre-registration
`migrations/kingdom_realms.sql`: that file carried no `COLLATE` clause, so its
table holds the character set's default collation instead of
`utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, and a guarded `CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE
utf8mb4_unicode_ci` brings it to the verified shape. Every column is an integer,
so the conversion changes no stored value, and on an already-correct table the
guard issues no `ALTER` at all, which is what keeps 0006 exactly re-runnable.

0007 replaces the `pkill_event.stamp` default. The column was created as
`DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00'`, which a server enabling
`NO_ZERO_DATE` and `NO_ZERO_IN_DATE` refuses to load, and which pushed consumers
into relaxing their session SQL mode to write the table at all. Every current
writer supplies `NOW()` explicitly, so the default is only a safety net;
`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` expresses that portably. Rows written before strict mode was
enabled may still hold the zero value and would fail the `ALTER`, so they are
first normalized to the epoch, which carries the same absence of information in
a form both engines accept. The guard reads the whole contract its verification
step asserts - `DATETIME`, `NOT NULL`, a current-timestamp default, and no
surviving zero-date rows - so a converged database issues no `ALTER` and the step
stays exactly re-runnable, while a partially converged one is still repaired.

0008 adds `idx_statistics_date` to the `statistics` population time series,
which carried only its primary key while every consumer filters an epoch range
on `date` and sorts chronologically. MySQL 8 has no portable
`CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, so the guard reads `information_schema` first and
issues no `ALTER` when an index of exactly the verified shape - a single
non-unique entry on `date` - is present; an index of that name with any other
shape is dropped and rebuilt. The index is a structural
correction; its latency benefit has not been measured on a representative clone.

`kingdom_realms` is part of the boot contract's *table list*: both
normalized metadata fingerprints are sealed over an inventory that includes it,
so on the database backend the gate proves the table's engine, collation,
columns and indexes before gameplay publishes. `kingdom_initialize()` still
disables kingdoms for the boot when it cannot read the table, which remains
reachable on the flat-file build, where no boot gate stands in front of it. The
*ledger* is fail-closed too, exactly as it is for every other immutable
migration: `src/core/runtime_compatibility_contract.h` compiles
`RUNTIME_MIGRATION_HEAD_ID` and its sequence, and
`sql_verify_boot_database()` in `src/sql/sql.c` requires the matching
`mud_schema_history` row, its two checksums, and the applied count in
`mud_schema_migration_state`. On the MariaDB/MySQL backend a database left at
an older head therefore refuses to boot, aborting with
`COMPAT-E002`. An operator upgrading an existing database must apply the pending
migrations with
`python3 scripts/migration_runner.py run`, which applies the SQL, runs the
verifier, and only then writes the history row and advances the head, before
starting the server.

The remaining registered steps add the kingdom garrison roster (0009),
committed coin-pile custody payloads (0010), player death disposition and custody
evidence (0011), and atomic epic-stone reward claims (0012). Migration 0012 adds
one InnoDB table keyed by the stone's globally allocated UID, with a foreign
key to the critical-operation inbox. An existing database at head 0011 must
apply that step before deploying the current server.

Migration 0013 preserves generated pet state, and 0014 adds telemetry storage. Migration 0015 adds the independent
physical-item mana authority, keyed by UID and versioned separately from owner
snapshots. An existing database at head 0014 must apply 0015 before the updated
binary boots, even when item actions remain disabled. This additive table has no
owner foreign key or cascade: extraction and old snapshots must not remove its
replay fence. See [artifact mana](../reference/ARTIFACT_MANA.md) for the resource,
crash-window and rollback contracts.

Migration 0034 is the one step that removes data: it drops the death custody and
restitution tables (0011, 0020) and the economy accounting tables (0031, 0032), which
nothing reads since the persistence reset treats every server as new. It is guarded
and re-runnable (`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`). Back up a database that may still hold that
evidence before running it.

Migration 0035 changes no table. Boot refuses an `account_banks` row without a
`currency_bank_baseline`, and from the persistence reset until the server
wrote the baseline with the bank, the delta that created a bank wrote none. The step
copies each such bank's current row into its baseline (`INSERT IGNORE ... SELECT`, so
it leaves existing baselines alone and re-runs), and its verifier requires every bank
to have one.

Migration 0036 widens `log_entries.ip_address` from `VARCHAR(15)` to `VARCHAR(45)`, as
`account_ips` has: `sql_log()` cut every IPv6 address to fit. The guard reads the column's
length and issues no `ALTER` once it holds 45, so the step re-runs, and its verifier checks
the shape. An existing database must apply it before the updated binary boots.

## Post-baseline migration contract

Files live under `migrations/immutable/` and are listed explicitly in the manifest.
Before opening a database, the runner reads every file with no-follow and fixed-size
limits and rejects duplicate JSON keys, invalid paths, missing/duplicate/reordered IDs,
unknown fields, and checksum changes.

At runtime it acquires one database lock, verifies the adopted baseline, validates the
entire applied prefix, and checks the singleton history count/head checksum. For each
pending migration it runs apply, then verifier, and only then atomically inserts the
history row and advances the history head. A verifier failure leaves the step
unrecorded. The migration itself must therefore be additive and re-runnable so an exact
retry can finish partial MySQL DDL safely.

Editing or reordering an applied row fails against the manifest. Deleting even the
trailing row fails against the retained history count/head rather than silently
reclassifying it as pending. Exact replay with a complete prefix performs no work.

## Verification

```sh
python3 tests/async/test_immutable_migration_runner.py
tests/async/run_legacy_migration_mysql.sh
tests/async/run_immutable_migration_ledger_mysql.sh
tests/async/run_runtime_compatibility_mysql.sh
RUNTIME_DB_IMAGE=mariadb:10.11 tests/async/run_runtime_compatibility_mysql.sh
```

The isolated MySQL tests verify the full legacy upgrade, exact fresh-bootstrap
equivalence, replay, schema compatibility, ordered uniqueness, honest baseline kind
uniqueness, preservation of legacy data-copy markers, and record-preserving
convergence of the pre-b029 `server_reboots` table on both supported engines.
