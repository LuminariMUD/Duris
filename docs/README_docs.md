# Documentation Index

Read the selected guides in the [project documentation library](https://community-duris.github.io/Duris/#documentation).
See [Project website](guides/GITHUB_PAGES.md) for publishing and local development.

Setup and first boot live in the root [README](../README.md); its Quick start is the
onboarding path. This directory holds the verified development, architecture,
operations, database, and builder references.

## Decisions and diagrams

- [Architecture decision template](adr/0000-template.md)
- [Refactor investigations #343-#347](adr/0001-refactor-investigation-343-347.md): alternatives,
  chosen ownership boundaries, performance risks, dependencies, and migration/test gates.
- [Server architecture diagram](diagrams/duris-server-architecture.html) and
  [database model](diagrams/duris-database-model.html)

## Legacy and runtime-data trees

- `legacy/` is inherited upstream reference text (`legacy/areas/`, `legacy/src/`) and
  may be stale.
- `lib/` is **not documentation**. `lib/information/` is read by the server at runtime
  (`src/cmd/wikihelp.c`, `src/account/nanny.c`) and by `scripts/import_help_to_prod.sh`; moving it
  breaks the running game.
