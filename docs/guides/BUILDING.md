# Building

Basic setup and first-boot instructions are in the root
[README.md](../../README.md). Runtime environment variables are documented in
[CONFIGURATION.md](../operations/CONFIGURATION.md). This document covers the build system
itself.

## Standard build

```bash
make                                    # server, editor, and area tools
make -C src                             # development server build
make -C src BUILD_PROFILE=production    # production server build
cp bin/server/dms_new bin/server/dms    # manually promote for a direct run
```

The server build has an explicit compile-time persistence dependency boundary:

```bash
make -C src PERSISTENCE_BACKEND=mariadb BUILD_PROFILE=development
make -C src PERSISTENCE_BACKEND=mariadb BUILD_PROFILE=production
make -C src PERSISTENCE_BACKEND=flatfile BUILD_PROFILE=development
```

`mariadb` is the default and includes and links the MySQL-compatible client. The
`flatfile` selection defines `__NO_MYSQL__` and does not add the MySQL include path or
client library. Backend/profile-specific objects are kept under
`bin/objects/server/<backend>/<profile>/`; the maintained `bin/server/dms_new` path is
relinked when either selection changes, so the commands can be run sequentially without
cleaning or reusing incompatible objects. `development` is the default, compiles at
`-Og` and defines `TEST_MUD`; `production` compiles at `-O2` and omits all
development-only behavior. The production launcher
checks the build stamp before promoting or running a binary. Each binary accepts only
its matching primary runtime mode. The legacy
`mariadb-primary-flatfile-fallback` token remains recognized but fails closed because
mixed per-operation authority transfer is not supported.

Mixed legacy modules still mention MySQL types while their durable operations are being
moved behind backend repositories. Flat builds resolve those declarations through
`src/no_mysql/`, a client-free compatibility surface whose connection, query, statement,
and thread initialization calls always fail. It neither connects nor persists data and
must not be treated as a backend; flat-file primary routes durable operations through
the corresponding file repositories instead of this compatibility surface.

The root `Makefile` is the maintained full-project entry point. `make clean`
removes compiled server, editor, and area-tool artifacts but preserves generated
world data, the active runtime, package artifacts, and runtime history. Every
compiled artifact belongs below `bin/`, whose contents are gitignored:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/server/` | Staged, active, and sanitizer server executables. |
| `bin/server/history/` | Bounded runtime executable history. |
| `bin/areas/` | Area editor and generation tools. |
| `bin/migrations/`, `bin/tools/` | Standalone maintenance utilities. |
| `bin/objects/` | Object and dependency files for every build flavor. |
| `bin/packages/` | Debian package and package metadata. |
| `bin/tests/` | Native test executables. |

Use `make clean-all` to remove every reproducible developer artifact. It
removes all generated contents below `bin/`, combined and scratch world
outputs, generated lookup tables, diagnostic-build output, coverage/profile
data, and Python/tool caches. It preserves `.env`, logs, player and account
data, and the hand-maintained `areas/world.justice`, `world.tab`, and
`world.weather` runtime inputs.

## Compile flags

From the default build line:

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-std=c++20` | All `.c` files are compiled as C++20 with g++. |
| `-Og` / `-O2` | `BUILD_PROFILE=development` stays debuggable at `-Og`; `BUILD_PROFILE=production` is optimised at `-O2`. |
| `-DTEST_MUD` | Added only by `BUILD_PROFILE=development`; enables development-only commands and behavior. |
| `-D__NO_MYSQL__` | Selected by `PERSISTENCE_BACKEND=flatfile`; removes the client compile/link dependency. |

Redis is optional at runtime, but Hiredis and OpenSSL remain build dependencies because
one server binary supports both the enabled and disabled runtime configurations.

`HARDENING_FLAGS` adds `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 -fstack-protector-strong
-fstack-clash-protection` to both profiles. `EXTRA_CFLAGS` / `EXTRA_LDFLAGS` are
appended last and exist so a wrapper (notably `scripts/build-san.sh`) can add
instrumentation without discarding the warning profile or the feature defines.

Link libraries: `mysqlclient`, `gnutls`, `ssl`, `crypto`, `cjson`, `hiredis`,
`bsd`, `curl`, `xml2`, `z`, `crypt`, `pthread`. Both backends link `curl`
(libcurl, the `libcurl4-gnutls-dev` package): it carries the SMTP path for account
password recovery, which stays disabled at runtime unless `MAIL_ENABLED=TRUE`.

Chaos gameplay mode is selected at runtime with `CHAOS_MUD=TRUE` or
`CHAOS_MUD=FALSE` in `.env`. The default example disables it. The value must
use uppercase `TRUE` or `FALSE`; numeric values are not supported. See
[CONFIGURATION.md](../operations/CONFIGURATION.md) for this and the other runtime switches.

Dependency install lines are in [README.md](../../README.md#quick-start). The
`packaging/` directory contains the equivs manifest for the complete developer
toolset, including Git, Python, area-generation utilities, the
compiler-provided sanitizer runtimes, Valgrind, GDB, and clang-format. It
accepts an existing MariaDB or MySQL toolchain and otherwise uses the
distribution's default MySQL-compatible packages.

## Warning profile

`src/Makefile`'s `WARNING_FLAGS` is `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror` plus an
explicit list of correctness and hardening diagnostics. There are **no**
`-Wno-*` exceptions, and six categories that are not implied by `-Wall
-Wextra` are named explicitly so the guarantee is deliberate rather than
incidental:

`-Wwrite-strings`, `-Wunused-parameter`, `-Wunused-variable`,
`-Wunused-but-set-variable`, `-Wmissing-field-initializers`,
`-Wunused-function`.

Those six were global exceptions until August 2026, hiding ~9,950 diagnostics.
Clearing them surfaced real defects - five `MAX_STRING_LENGTH`-bounded formats
writing into 256/512-byte caller buffers, a truncated player-save `INSERT`
handed to MySQL as malformed SQL, and a WebSocket handler that was never wired
into its dispatcher - so the rules below exist to keep the signal trustworthy:

1. Never reintroduce a blanket `-Wno-*` flag, a warning pragma, or a file-wide
   suppression. Resolve the diagnostic instead.
   `tests/async/test_compiler_warning_profile.py` fails if one appears.
2. Use `[[maybe_unused]]` only where a build configuration genuinely needs the
   declaration - typically a parameter whose only use sits inside an inactive
   `#if`. Never to hide unexplained dead state.
3. Do not use `const_cast` or a C-style cast to satisfy `-Wwrite-strings`. Make
   the callee `const char *` when it does not write through the pointer; give
   it a mutable buffer when it does (see `writable_arg` in
   [CODEBASE.md](../reference/CODEBASE.md#c-conventions-the-warning-profile-enforces)).
4. Do not delete a set-but-unused calculation until its intended effect is
   understood - it often marks a missing check, charge, or return value.

`scripts/warning-inventory.sh` performs a clean build with the six categories
enabled but non-fatal and writes deduplicated counts by category and by file to
`build/warning-inventory/{raw.log,dedup.txt,report.txt}` (`build/` is
gitignored). The report records the compiler version and the full flag set so
counts stay comparable across runs.

Note that `-Wformat-truncation=2` is fatal: `snprintf` into a fixed buffer must
have a bound the compiler can narrow. Format each row into its own bounded
buffer rather than appending at `buf + strlen(buf)` with a
`MAX_STRING_LENGTH` bound.

The warnings that follow values (`-Wnull-dereference`, `-Wmaybe-uninitialized`,
`-Wformat-truncation`, `-Wstringop-overflow`, `-Warray-bounds`,
`-Wstrict-overflow`) see further at `-O2`, through inlined code, so the
production profile reports sites the development build does not. `make
test-all` builds both: `make build-production` compiles the production profile
into its own object directory and `bin/server/production/dms_new`, leaving
`bin/server/dms_new` to the development build. Resolve what it reports the same
way: the first `-O2` build found a staff command writing ten bytes over five
and an event whose inverted check dereferenced NULL.

When a change touches conditional code, compile-sweep the affected files under
the non-default configurations as well - `REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`,
`CTF_MUD=1`, and `MEMCHK` are the ones in use:

```bash
g++ -fsyntax-only -std=c++20 -DTEST_MUD -DCTF_MUD=1 ... src/<file>.c
```

## Sanitizer build

`scripts/build-san.sh` builds an ASan/UBSan instrumented binary for hunting
memory bugs. The sanitizer runtimes arrive with the compiler declared by the
developer dependency manifest; no separate sanitizer package is needed. Use
this build for debugging sessions, not for production.

It appends its flags through `EXTRA_CFLAGS`/`EXTRA_LDFLAGS` so the full warning
profile is preserved, builds objects into `bin/objects/server-san/`, and leaves
its result at `bin/server/dms_san` - it never touches `bin/server/dms`. Do not
switch it back to `export CFLAGS=...`: a Makefile assignment overrides an
exported variable, so the flags would silently never reach the compiler.

Usage, tool selection, and the rules for when a dynamic check is required are
in [MEMORY_CHECKING.md](MEMORY_CHECKING.md).

## Area file generation

The server boots from combined area files (`areas/world.wld`, `world.mob`,
`world.obj`, `world.zon`, `world.qst`, `world.trg`, plus lookup tables). These
are generated, not hand-edited:

1. Build the compilers: `make build-area-tools` (produces `make_mob`,
   `make_obj`, `make_qst`, `make_shp`, `make_trg`, `make_wld`, and `make_zon`
   under `bin/areas/tools/`).
2. Generate: `make world` (runs `areas/m_slow`, including lookup generation).

The seven independent compiler builds inherit GNU Make's jobserver, so
`make -j"$(nproc)"` can build them in parallel. Generation scripts stop on the
first failed command instead of leaving a partially refreshed world behind.
The root target records an ignored `areas/.world.stamp` and skips regeneration
when every required output exists and all area sources and tools are unchanged.

Per-area source directories (`areas/wld/`, `areas/mob/`, ...) hold editable
area data; the combined outputs land in `areas/world.*`. An area's studio-proc
triggers are `areas/trg/<area>.trg`, optional like its quests; `make_trg` checks
their framing and fails generation with the file and line of a malformed one
([STUDIOPROC.md](../content/STUDIOPROC.md)).

`scripts/cycle_mud.sh` performs both steps automatically when the helper
binaries are missing, so first boot after a fresh clone works without manual
intervention.

## Finding unreachable code

The linker can list the functions no build reaches. Build both servers with one section
per function, in object directories of their own so the normal build is not disturbed:

```sh
make -C src -j16 OBJDIR=$PWD/bin/analysis/objects SERVER_BIN_DIR=$PWD/bin/analysis \
    DMS_BINARY=$PWD/bin/analysis/dms_new EXTRA_CFLAGS="-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections"
make -C src -j16 PERSISTENCE_BACKEND=flatfile OBJDIR=$PWD/bin/analysis/flat-objects \
    SERVER_BIN_DIR=$PWD/bin/analysis/flat DMS_BINARY=$PWD/bin/analysis/flat/dms_new \
    EXTRA_CFLAGS="-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections"
```

Then rerun each build's final link line from `src/` without `-rdynamic` and with
`-Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--print-gc-sections`. Each `removing unused section
'.text.<symbol>'` line names a function that build never reaches. Demangle with `c++filt`,
and read `st_mysql` as `MYSQL` (the flat-file build stubs it).

A function is dead when every build that compiles it drops it. The list is a lead, not
proof, so read the source first: a function reached only through a dead branch shows as
live, and an inlined one shows as dead. The linker also cannot see a dead branch inside a
live function.

## Verifying a build

- Recompile check: `make -C src` must complete without errors or warnings in
  touched files.
- Full build and regression gate: `make test-all`.
- Smoke test on a development port (uses `duris_dev`, never production):

  ```bash
  ./bin/server/dms 4000 &
  sleep 5 && nc localhost 4000   # confirm greeting, then shut down
  ```

- If you changed persistence-related code, run the relevant focused test;
  see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
